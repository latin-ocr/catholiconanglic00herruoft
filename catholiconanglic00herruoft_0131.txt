¹ The author of the Ancren Riwle tells us, p. 256, that ‘a 111ῄο [small] elect mei lod-
lichen swusse a muchel ihol peche ;⁷ and again, on p. 260, our lord is described as ‘mid elates
biw1·abled,⁷ wrapped in clouts or rags. In Havelok, Quin first binds Havelok and then
gags him with a ‘ keuel [ἕεις] of eluces ;’ and in Sir Ferunibras, l. 2747, Guy of Burgundy
is blindfolded with a ‘ elmete? A. S. ellat.

² An iron plate. Amongst the ixnplements, &c.‚ necessary to the sarmer, Tusser enume-
rates a ‘ strong exeltred cart, that is clozcted and shod ;' and-

⁶Two ploughs and a plough chein, ij culters, iij shares,
With ground docetes and side dolates, for 30110 that so tares.'
Five Hundred Puints, διο. p. 36.

In the Pas-ton Lenem, ed. Gairdner. ii. 125, we have ‘ οἶοι 311011,’ i. e. shoes tipped with
iron. Cooper renders Crasso by ‘bullions or ornalnentes of plate that may be· taken off.’
See also Carte bande and Cop bande.

described as sitting ‘clozc3tancl kyndely his schon.' A. S. clntz‘aem. Wyolifi Wks. ed. Arnold.

bondis ben uelum-sid} [diss-olzene sum manas nostran] where apparently it has the meaning
of παυώθιί, and hence useless, wealc. So again in Purvey's version of Zephaniah iii. 16,
‘Jerusalmm nyle thou drede3 Sion thin houdis be not almas-ww [non dissolvantur numus
taae .] where other versions read ‘aclamsitl ’ and ⁶ aczomhledf Holland in his trans. of
Livy, Bk. xxi. c. 56, p. 425, renders torpentes (selu by ‘ so clumsie & frozen :' and in the
Gospel of Nichodemus, lf. 213, we read ‘we er clomsecl gret a11dS111alle.‘ See also E.
Eng. Poems, ed. 1862, p. 123. Ray in his Glossary of North Country VVords gives
‘Clumps‚ clumpst, idle, lazy, unhandy; έπεμψε( and refers to Skinner. who, 111 1113 Ety-
mologicon says itis a word ‘agro Lincolniensi usitatissima? Cleomsomc or Classonw is
still in use about Whitby. In P. Plowman, Β. xiv. 50, we read—

‘WVhan pou clomsest for cold, or clyngest for drye;’

on which see Prof. Skeat's note. ⁶ Entombi. Stonied, benunnned, clumpse, asleep. chi

nogyfdxlffzigitijggsshnd Dindimus, E. E. Text Soc. ed. Skeat‚ l. 1 58, we read how Alexander,
when he had arrived at the river Pison, was unable to cross it on account of the

drillus‚ A cocadrylle.’ Wright’s V01.0f Vocab. p. 220. The Low Latin cocodrillus, itself a
corruption from crocodilus, was still further corrupted into vocatrix, whence our cockatrice.
The basilisk was supposed to have the property of infecting the air with its venom 30 that
no other creature could live near it, and also of killing men by a mere look. In the Gesta
Roman. chap. 57, is an account of one which in this way destroyed a large number of the
soldicrs of Alexander, and of the means adopted to destroy the monster. See a full
