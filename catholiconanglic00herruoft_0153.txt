² The term daubozcrs occurs in the Liber Custumarum, p. 99, in the sense of layers
on, to a sramework, of a mixture of straw and mud. employed in the construction of
fences and house-walls. In Cheshire. according to Mr.Riley, the process is termed flowing]
(see Cheshire Glossary by Col. Leigh‚ p. 142). In France the composition is known as
ferehis, and in Devonshire as cob. The process of daubiny is alluded to more than
once in our Translation of the Old Testament. See for instance Wyclif's version of
Ezekiel xiii. 10, 11. The word, according to Mr. H. Nicol, is from O. Fr. daubei-:to
plaster, from Latin dealbare=t0 whiten. WVedgwood derives dawb from dab, ‘an
imitation of the sound made by throwing down a lump of something moise! ‘Bazqsa
