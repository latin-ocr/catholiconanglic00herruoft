lowing recipe sor making Bra-gget is given in Cogan's Haven of Health, p. 230: ‘ Take
three or foure gallons of good ale, or more, as you please, two daies or three after it is
cleansed, and put it in a potte by it selfe, then draw forth a pottel then-eof, and put to it a
quart of good English Hony, and set them ouer the fire in a vessell, and let them boyle
fair and softly‚ and alwaies as any froth ariseth, scumnie it away and so clarifie it; and
when it is well clarified, take it off the 111-0, and let it coole. and put thereto of Pepper a peny-
worth, Cloves, Mace, Ginger, Nutmegs‚ Cinamon, of each two penny worth beaten to
powder, stir them well together, anal set them ouer the fire to boyle againe a while,
then being Millie—warnie, put it to the rest, and stirz'e all together, & let it stand two
01· three daies, and put banne upon it. and (11111κο it at your pleasure.’ In Lancashire
Braggat is drunk on Mhi-Lem Sunday, 111-111111 is hence called Brayyut Sandrey.
