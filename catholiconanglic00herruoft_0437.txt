1688, says : ‘These are made of wnod, and are fastned by iron hooks, stables, chains, and
pinns to the Coach-pole‚ to the which Horses are fastned by their Harnish when there is
more then two to draw the Coach.’ Bk. iii. ch. viii. n0. 33. ‘ They [the horses] must have
hombers or collers, holmes withed about theyr neekes, tresses to drawe by, and a swynyletre
to holde the tresses abrode, and a togewith to be bytwene the swynyletre and the ha1·owe.'

⁸ According to Strutt the Tabard was ‘ a species of mantle which covered the front of
the body and the back, but was open at the sides firom the shoulders downwards ; in the
early representations of the tabard it appears to have been of equal length before and
behind, and reached a little lower than the loins.' ‘Tabard‚ a garment, manteau? Pals-
grave. ‘ A jaquet 01· sleeveless coat worn in times past by noblemen in the wmres, but
now only by heranlts, and is called theyr coat of armes in servyse.' Speght’s Gloesary,
