³ ‘ The prima-ry meaning of this word [trutannus] has not been accurately ascertained,
but it seems to have been most generally used for a person who wandered about, and
gained his living by false pretences, or passed himself under a different character to that
which really belonged to him. It is applied sometimes to abbots and priors who lived
abroad, and neglected their monasteries, or to monks who had quibbed their houses, as in
a passage of Giraldus Cambrensis OVharton, Auylz'a Sacra, vol. iii. p. 575).’ Note by Mr.
Wright in Political Sonsss, Camden Soc. p, 376, on the following line from a song on the
Scottish Wars, temp. Edw. 1: ‘Fallax die proelii fugit 111, trutannus? Canon, inthe
Golden Leyend, fo. 359, 601. 4, applies the term to vagrancy: ‘There were thenne two

dicantes].⁵ Cotgrave gives ‘ Trumzd, m. a common beggar, vagabond, rogue, a lazie
