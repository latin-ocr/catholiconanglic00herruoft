¹ An advocate. Hauiwell quotes—-
‘To consente to a fals juggymg, Or hyredyst, a voi-et to a swyche thyng?
MS. Harl. 1701, leaf 36.
In the fable of the Cat and the Fox in Gexta Romanorum, p. 372, we are told that ‘ bi the
foxe are vndirstondyn volcettes . . . . . pat han xviijssu sleighnes„ aud wiles passyng tho a
pokefull.' ‘Volcettys ten or twelfe may none help at this nede.’ Towneley Mysteries, p.
305. ‘Cau.sicliczc.<·, a Voket.' Medulla.
² Baret gives ‘a woman’s cap, hood, or bonet, calypti-a, caliendrum) In the description
of Alison given in the Miller's Tale we read—
‘The tapes of hir white volzipere Weren of the samo sute of hire colere.’ 1. 3241.
See also the Βᾶθι-63 Tale, 4303: ⁵ She wende the Clerke had wered a volupcre!
³ ‘Venta f. A vault or arch3 also avaulted or embowed roofe.' Cotgrave. ‘Hec archus,
a vowt.’ W'right's Vol. of Vooab. 236. In Trevisa's Higden, i. 221, we have the curious
form fot .· ‘adamant stones bat. were in the fot [in a1·ceibzcs].’ In the Destruet. of Troy,
1607, we lia-ve the word used for an underground passage or channel: ‘the water . . . .
gosshet through Godardys and other great mutes? See Vawte, above, p. 400, and the
quotation from Caxton s. V. Vyce, above.
² ‘The hyl-chon . . . . yf he mete ony beste that wold doo hym harme, he reduyseth
hym self as rounde as a bowle.' caston, ,ΜΨ-νοω· of the World. pt. ii. ch. xv. p. 100 ; and
again, ‘The H gfff-lion whan he syndeth apples beten or blowen doun of a tree he waloweth
on them tyl he be chargid and laden with the fruyt stykyng on their pryckes.’ ibid.
Horman says: ⁴ Yrclzyns or hedge boggis full of sharpe prylzyllis whan they know that
they be hunted make them rounde lyke a balle 3 and again, ‘Porpyns haue longer
prykels than yrchyns)
‘Hilles hegh til hertes ma, And pe stane, bi dai and nightz
Vntil irehmzae es toflightff Earl 1! Εηῃ. Ρεαῖῐθν, Ps. ciii. 18.
Lyte, Dodoens‚ p. 729, says ‘chat chestnuts are enclosed in ‘ very rough and prickley huskes
lyke to a Hedgehogge or Vrclzin? ‘ Irnioins, an Vrchin.' Medulla. See the eurious
remedy ‘for hym that haves the squynansyj given in Ia'eliq. Antiq. i. 51, the principal
ingredients of which are the guts of a ‘ fatte katte and the grees of an arc-licon, and the
fatte of a bare, &cs ‘ Histri& est animal spinosmn, an vrohen.' Ortus. ‘ Echinus, crelion
fisshe is, as I gesse.' Palladius On Has-hondrie, p. 58, 1. 404. Wyclif, in his version of
Isaiah xiv. 25, lias ε ⁵ I shall putte it [Babylonl in to the possessioun of an irclzozm and in
to myres of watres ;' and again, Psalm eiii. 18 z ‘the ston requ to iJ-chozmes! In the de-
scription of Danger in the Romami( of tlte Ruso, 3135, it is said that ‘ like sharpe urchons
his haire was grew] See the burlesque poeni from a 15th cent. MS. in Reliq. Amiq. i. 81:
‘A ‘noreiam by the fyre rosbyng a greyhownde) At p. 302 of the same volume in the
‘Booke of Hawkyng, after Prince Edward, Kyng of Euglande,’ c. 1450, is given the fol-
lowing recipe : ‘ For the cramp in hawkes leg-ges. Fede hym with an Irclzyn, and but that
avayle, take ‘che hote blode of a lambe, ancl anoynt his leggs unto the tyme he be hole 3’
