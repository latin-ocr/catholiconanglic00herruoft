A hoel: was an instrument or engine for catching fish, made in the form of lamiae-work, or

a grating. It appears to have been peculiar to or principally used in the river Ouse in
Yorkshire. So Ducange, ‘ Heck, Retis genus, quo utuntur piscatores, fluvii Isidis Ebora—
censis accolae? These engines appear to have increased to such an extent as to become a
source of danger and interruption to the traffic on the river. The Mayor and Corporation
of York accordingly presented a petition on the subject, the result being that by the Stat.
23 Henry VIII. cap. 18, the Magistrates having jurisdiction over the river Ouse were
empowered to cause ‘as much of the said fishgarthes, piles‚ stakes, neck-es and other engines,
which then by their discretione shall he thought expedient ..... to be pulled up, that
the said ships, keyleS‚ cogges, boats and other vessels ..... may have direct, liberall,
and franke passage! A heah-boat, or hekbett, would therefore appear to be a fishing boat
using this particular engine for catching fish. In Ad. Smyth’s &ailor's Word-Book, 1867,
a Heckboat is defined as ‘the old term for pinks. Latterly a clincher-built boat with
covered fore-sheets and one mast with a trysail ;’ and a Pz'nk in its turn is described as ‘ a
ehip with a very narrow stem, having a small square part above?
