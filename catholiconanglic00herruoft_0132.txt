² MS. astula, corrected by A. 3 but perhaps we should read arcula.

³ In the Owle and Nightingale, ed. Stratinalin, 86, we find ‘ Frogge pat 511 at mulne

in an indented wheel.

‘ Coker. A reaper (Warwick). Originally a charcoal lnaker who comes out at harvest time.'
Halliwell. It seems rather to mean a harvest labourer, one who puts hay into 000715. (See
cok of hayr) Richardson quotes the following :—‘ Bee it also prouided that this act, nor
anything therein contained doe in any wise extende to any Goelzer-s or harnest folkes that
trauaile into anie countrie of this realme for haruest worke, either come haruest or hay-
haruest, isthey doe worke and labour accordingly.y Rastall, Statutes, Vaga-bonds, δῖα, p. 474.

⁸ Panis de Coket is mentioned in a MS. of Jesus Coll. Oxford, Ι Arch. i. 29, leaf 268,
as being slightly inferior to waste] bread. ‘A cochet was a kind of sea] (see Liber Albus,
p. 45, and Madox, Hist. Excheq. i. p. 783), and as bread in London was sealed with the
baker's seal, after inspection by the Alderman, it is not improbable that this bread thence
had its name3 though at some periods certainly, other kinds of bread, distinguished in
name from Cocket-bread were sealed as well. . . . . (beket-breccrl was most used probably
by the middle classes 3 that of inferior quality being trcte 01· lom-te, while simne? and wastel
were finer in quality and higher in price.⁸ Liber Custumarum, ed. Riley, ii. 793. See
