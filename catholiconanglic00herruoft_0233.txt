¹ ίδέ1ηἰραζχαηιιὺκ Half a rustici< or clown.' Gouldman.

² ‘ There is evidently some confusion here: apparently the scribe has repeated half bare
in another form and omitted the English equivalent for semipondo and quadrans, which
would be ‘half a halpenny :⁷ compare a Halpeny‚ below, where pondo is given as the
Latin equivalent.

³ Dr. Oliver, in his Monasticon Diseresis Emmiensoze, p. 260, says—‘Aqlcebqjult' were
persons who carried the vessel of the holy water in processions, and benedictione. Scholars
in the minor orders were always to be preferred for this office (vide Synod. Exoniens. A.D.
1287, cap. 29). In small parishes the aquebajulus occasionally acted as sacristan aud rang
the bell? By a decree of Arohbishop Bonifaee, the aquebajulzcs was to be a poor clerk,
appointed to his office by the curate of the chureh, and maintained by the ahns of the
parishioners in all paris-hes in his province within ten miles of a city or eastle. His duties
were to serve the priest at the altars to read the epistle‚ sing the gradual aud the responses,
read the lections, carry the lioly-water vessel, and assist at the eanonical hours and the
ministration of the sacraments (see Lyndwode‚ l'ib. iii. pp. 142—3). He was in fact a poor
scholar, and the office was given him to assist him in his studies—⁶ ιιί ibidem proficeret ut
aptior et mayz's idoneus fieret ad majoros After the Reformation the office merged into
that of parish clerk. Thus, in 1613, William Cotton, Bishop of Exetw, licensed John
Randolph to the ‘officium aquebajzcli sire alerici parochialis apud Gzcemzap, et docendi
artem scribendi et leqendi! (Hist. Cornwalt ii. p. 135). From the latter part of this
extract he would seem to have officiated also as village schoohnaster. ‘ Aquarius: serviens
qni porcat aquam? Medulla. ‘Hie aqaebajzolns. A holi water clerke.' Wright’s Vol. of
Vocab. p. 218. Robert of Brunne complains that any

‘ Holy icatyr οῖον-11· of a tounne
l‘at lytyl haJ) lernede yn hys lyue
He ys ordeyuede a presb to shrvue.’
Hancllynq ofSynne, ed. Furnivall, p. 360, 11. 11591—4.

From this office being usually performed by some poor scholar, the term Holy-water clerk
eventually came to be applied to such exclusively. Thus in the State Papem, ii. 141, ue
read—⁶ Anthony Knevet hath obteyned the Bisshoprik of Kildare to a symple Irish preste,

a vagabounde‚ without lernyng, lnaners, or good quasstye, not worthy to be a bully-water
clero! The term also occurs= in Lydgate.

⁴ In Riclmml the Redeles, iii. 218, we find hales used in the sense of teuts—
‘ He woudrid in his wittis. as he wel 111y3the,

bat pe hie housffige, herborowe ne myghte

Cecily, Marchioness of Dorset‚ to Thomas Croznwell, pr. in Ellis' 0νίῃίηαί Letters, Ser. I.
vol. i. p. 219, she desit-es him to ⁴ delyver all such tents, pzzvylyous⁹ and lculcs as you haue
