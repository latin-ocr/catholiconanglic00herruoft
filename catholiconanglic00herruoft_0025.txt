INTRODUCTION. XV

16 quires or 192 leaves¹‚ 182 of which contain the text, followed
by 6 blank. Then on leaf 189 comes the list of terms of rela-
tionship reprinted at the end of our text. This list is in a
different hand from that in which the main body of the book
has been written, and appetam, to me at least, to be the same
with that in which the corrections and additions have been
made in the original scribe's work. These corrections are few
in number, the copying having been on the whole very care-
fully done. Mr. Way was of opinion that it was probable that
this MS. was the author's holograph 2, but this is very doubtful,
and is contradieted by the fact that the corrections are in a
different hand. In addition to this, in the next paragraph Mr.
lVay speaking of the Addit. MS. 1 5, 562, assigns to it the date
of 1450. But the handwritings are essentially different. Either,
therefore, the date assigned to the Addit. MS. must be wrong,
or Lord Monson’s MS. can not be the author's holograph. But
I do not believe that 1450 is the correct date of the Addit. MS.
hlore probably it was compiled about 147 5, the date assigned
to it in the Museum Catalogue. The numberless‚ and frequently
most extraordinary, mistakes in the Addit. MS. show clearly
that it was a copy from an earlier MS„ and probably written
from dictation.

On the back of the last leaf of Lord Monson's MS. is the
following: ‘Liber Thome Flowre Succeufor ecclesie Cathedralis
beate Marie Lincoln. Anno domini M.ccccc.xx 3’ on which Mr.
Way notes 3 that he could not find the name of Thomas Flower,
sub·ehanter‚ in the Fasti of Lincoln‚ but that a John Flower
occurs among the prebendaries of that church in 1571. He
adds that the owner of Lord Monson’s MS. may have been of
Lincoln College, Oxford, since a Thomas Flower was one of the
proctors of the University in 1519 4. Immediately above this,
in fadcd ink, is the following entry, unmentioned by Mr. Way:
‘Anno domini millesimo ccccmo lxxxxm ix0‚ Anno regni regis
Henriei 71, post conquestum quintodecimo,' which is interesting
