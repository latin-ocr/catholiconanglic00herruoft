‘ Three kinds of oil were used in the Catholic Church—olemn sanctum, oleum chrismatis,
and oleam infirmorum. With the first, called in the above extract from Myro, creme, the
child was anointed ou the breast and between the shoulders, before it was plunged in the
font or sprinkled with water. After the baptism proper it was anointed on the head with
the sign of a cross with the oleum chrismatis or crism. The oleam infirmorum was that
used for the purposes of extreme unction. The three oils were kept in separate bottles in
a box called a chrismatory, which was in shape somewhat like the Noah's arks given to
children to play with? ¹ Crisma. Creexn.' Medulla. ‘ Creame holy oyle‚ cresme.’ Palsgrave.’
