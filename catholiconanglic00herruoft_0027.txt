INTRonrc‘sioN. xvii

given in the same succession. In the case of all words which
arc found only in A. and not in Lord Monson's MS. I have
printed an A in brackets (A.) at the end of the word 3 as Armyd3
armatus (Au) And when Ι have inserted various readings from
A. in the text Ι have enclosed them in brackets and appended
the letter (A.): thus the entry ‘a Oropure (cruppure A.);
postela (postellum A.)’ is intended to show that the reading of
Lord Monson’s MS. is ‘ a Oropure 3 posfela ;’ and that of the
Addit. MS. ⁶ a Cruppure3 postellum?

After the first few pages I have, in order to economise space,
omitted the inflexional endings of the genitive cases of nouns,
and the feminine and neuter genders of adjectives. But no
alteration has been made in the text without due notice in the
notes ¹. I have expanded the contractions, showing the expan-
sions as usual by the use of italics: Η and ’ὦ Ι have treated as
representing lle and ne respectively3 but ἦ Ι have printed as it
stands, it being doubtful what is the exact value of the mark of
contractiori. The author has throughout used vbi for ‘ see' or
‘refer to‚’ and participium). for our ‘ adjective.’

The method adopted in the compiling and arranging the nu-
merous notes required sor the work was as follows: Ι first went
caresully through the whole of the MS., comparing each word
with its representative in the Promptorium‚ and in cases where
no such representative could be found marking the word with
a dagger (†). Where Ι found that Mr. W‘ay had already anno-
tated the word I marked it with an asterisk (³²⁶). Ι am afraid
instances will be found of words, to which Ι have attached a
dag-ger, really occurring in the Promptorium, under a slightly
different form, sufficiently different to escape my notice.

The reading of books sor the purpose of getting together
illustrative quotations was a long and heavy‚ but far from

 

¹ Ι have not, even, except in very few cases, corrected the blunders in the scribe’s
latin. To do so throughout the work would completely alter its character, and
would, in a great measure, destroy the interest which attaches even to this base
latin. Like ΜΓ. lVay (see his Introd. p. vii), Ι could have made many more
alterations in this particular, as also 111 rearranging the words in a perfect alpha-
betic order, but the objections to so doing, as explained by Mr. WVay, appeared
to me so strong that I have preferred to print the MS. exactly as it is. In the
case of A. Ι have, of course, had to break the scribe's order of words, so as to bring
the corresponding words of the two MSS. together.
