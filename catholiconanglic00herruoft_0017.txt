PREFACE

BY

HENRY B. WHEATLEY‚ ESQ. F.S.A.

DE erxcnr said of a certain book that it was ‘the deadest
thing in creation, even (leader than a door nail‚' but one might
very naturally expect a mediaeval linguistic Dictionary to be a
still more dead thing. The object for which it was compiled
has long ago been ful'filled, and it has been superseded for
centuries. But, curiously enough, although useless for its
original purpose, it has become a priceless record of the
language. Old Dictionaries have long been used by commen-
tators to illustrate the language of our national classic& Thus
Douce frequently quotes from Huloet’s Abcedarium Anfflico-
[asinum in his Ill2c3frat2'0ns (gf Slaalcespeme, but the late Mr.
Albert Way was the first scholar to recognize the utility of an
old Dictionary as a whole, and to devote years of labour to the
illustration of the words in the oldest English-Latin Dictionary
extant. His varied learning peculiarly fitted him for the task he
had undertaken, and the tools with which he worked—a fine collec-
tion of Dictionaries—he bequeathed to the Society of Antiquaries.
In 1843 the first part of his edition of the Promptorium Parvulomm
sire Clerieormn appeared, and twenty-two years afterwards the
volume of 56 3 pages was completed. The Promptorimn exists in
several editions in MS. which date from about the year 1440. It
was printed by Pynson in 1499, by Julian Notary in 1508, and by
Wynkyn de Worde in 1510, 1512, 1516, and 1528. There is a
greater variety of Latin-English DictionarieS‚ but this was ap·-
parently the only available English-Latin Dictionary, and in
consequence it was frequently reproduced. All honour, there-
fore, is due to Geoffrey, the Norfolk Grammarian, who shut
himself in his cell in order to compile a much needed work

for the use of his countrymen. The difficulty of the undertaking
must have been very great in those days when the sacilities for
compilation were comparatively few.
