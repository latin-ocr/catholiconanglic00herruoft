ribdis, a swolow off the se.’ Medulla. ‘ Swallow, gulffe or such lyke. Vorayo! Huloet.

Crete, is described as having ‘a hard brest . . . . δε his back sware?

³ The swathe or row of grass cut down by a reaper. Grose defines it ‘ grass just cut to
be made into hay! In Morte Arthure, 1. 2508, we read—

‘ In the myste mornynge one a mede falles,
hIawene and vae-made, maynoyrede bott lvttylle,
In swatlzes sweppene downe fulle of swete fioures?

Vol. of Vocab. p. 154. ‘Take hede that thy mower mow elene and holde downe the
hynder hand of his sith, that he do not endent the grasse, and to mowe his swathe cleane-
throwe to that that was laste mowen before, that he leaue not a mane betwene.’ Fitz-

⁴ A pore in the skin. ‘ Hic porus, a swete holle] Wright's Vol. of Vocab. p. 209.

⁵ To play with swords was the usual phrase for fencing and gladiatorial contests. Com-
pare a Bucler plaer, above, p. 46. In the Ancren Riwle, p. 21 2, we have the expression
‘pleieo mid sweordes.‘ In Holinshed's Olcronicle, vol. iii. p. 1 3 33, we read of ‘tigres,
panthem, beares, and swordplaiers incountring one another to the death 3 and in Giraldus'
Hist. (gf Ireland, in Holinshed, ii. 27, is mentioned ‘ the plaie οι· game of swordplaiers or
maisters of desemel ⁴ Gladiatnra, a bokelere pleying.’ Medulla.
