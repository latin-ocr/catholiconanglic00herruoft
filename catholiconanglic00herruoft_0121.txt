³ The Constellation Ursa Major. Bootes was called either NVagoner to Charles' Wain
or Keeper to the Great Bear (arctophylax), according to the name given to the chief
northern group of fixed stars. (See Barrewarde ante.) Cooper gives ‘ Plaustrum. Charles
WVayne, nigh the North Pole.' The word occurs also 111 Gawin Douglas, and in the
hledulla we find ‘A rcopltilafce (sic). The carle wensterre. Artanes: quoddam signam celeste .·
anyhce, A carwaynesterre.' Withals mentions ‘ Charles XVaine. Vrsa minor, Cynosura‚’
and ‘A starre that followeth Charles waine. Bootes? Jamieson gives ‘Charlewan' and
‘ Charlewaigne.’ Compare Spenser, Faery Queene, Ι. 11. 1. A. S. carleswcbn. See also
Cotgrave 8. v. Bob'te. The idea 11181 Ο1181188’ Wain is a corruption of Chorles or Churls

who, as Spenser tells us, in the Tcares of tlte Mases, was placed by Calliope ⁴ amongst the
starris seaven,’ and who was addressed by the priests of Aix-la-Chapelle as ‘ Rex mundi
triumphator, J esu Christi conregnator.’ The XVoden’s &Vain of the North became the
Charles⁷ W*ain of the Teutons. Holland, in his trans. of Suetonius, p. 74, speaks of the
‘ starres of the 081881181 1)8818,’ the marginal note being ‘Ukm-lemaz'ne his waine,’ and in
Trevisa’s trans. of Bartholomaeus de Proprietatibas Rerum, viii. 35, we are told that
‘ Arcturus is comynly clepid in Englis Charlemaynes waync!
