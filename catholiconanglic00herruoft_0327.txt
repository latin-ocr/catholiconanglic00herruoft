¹ The bow of wood which goes round the neck of an oxe3 still in use. Tusser amongst

other implements, &c.‚ necessary to the sarnier mentions
‘ Oxbozoes and oxyokes and other things mo,
For oxteeme and horseteeme, in plough for to go.’ ch. xvii. st. 10.

Bibelsworth pr. in Wright's Vol. of Vocab. p. 169, (irsons are rendered by ⁶ oxe-bowes.'

² As much land as an ox could plough in a season: according to some fifteen, bnt
according to others twenty acres. ‘ Illas cle terre, au oxegang, plowland or hide of land,
containing about 20 acres and having a house belonging to it? Cotgrave. ⁶ An oxe-gang,
mas de terre,- contient 20 acres (c’est ὰ dire, art-pens cZ'Anylc‘terre).’ Sherwood. ‘Oxgang
of land. Vo'yfflti jussera terrie? Gouldman. An old account book of Darlington states that
30 a. is an oxgang in Sedgefield, 16 at Hurworth, and 20 in Yorkshire-in some places 8
acres seems to be the quantity. The Oxgang was generally 8 to the carucate, but some-
times 4; thus the carucata being what a team (of 8 oxen) could plough in the year, the
Oxgang stood for the work of one ox, and the plough being in some counties drawn but by
four oxen, accounts for there being in that case but four oxgangs to the carucate, or if
they be called 8, the average of each is proportionably reduced. Sir E. Colm, in his In-
stitutes‚ fo. 69, says : ‘ Others say that a knights fee containeth 680 acres z others say that
an oxeqanqe of Land containeth 15 acres, and eight oxyanys make a plowland ; by which
account a plowland containes 1 20 acres, and that virgata terrae, or a yard land containeth
20 acres.' See a long and exhaustive note on the word in H. Best's Farminy, ὥσ. ΒοοΙεε,
