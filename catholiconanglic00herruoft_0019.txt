PREFACE. ix

for the preparation of the notes, Mr. Herrtage has produced 3

” volume worthy to stand by the side of Mr. lVay's Promptorz'um,

and higher praise than this could scarcely be given to the book.
It is curicus to compare the Gztlaolieon with the Prornptorimlz,
and to see how thoroughly different the two Dictionaries are.
The Promptorz'm is the fuller of the two, and contains, roughly,
about 12,000 words, while thc Catholieon has about 8000 words ¹.

The Catholicon is specially valuable as a dated Dictionary.
At the end of the book we read: ‘ Explicit Catholicon in lingua
materna. Anno domini 1483 ς’ but the fact that there is another
MS. in the British Museum of Γ1 rather earlier date opens up a
curious question as to the origin of these Dictionaries. Mr. Way
suggests that Lord Monson's MS. may be the author's holograph,
but this opinion is scarcely tenable, more particularly as he him-
self mentions the older MS. in the British Museum, to which
Sir Frederic Madden had directed his attention. Although
these are evidently the same Dictionary, certain differences, as
indicated by Mr. Heri-tage in his Introduction, show that there
must have been a still earlier original from which both were
taken, whether directly, or indirectly through intermediate copies
we cannot now tell. Another point which we are unable to settle
is this: Were all these MSS. called Caffiolicon Aanicum, or was
this a name given specially to Lord Monson’s manuscript? Any
way, the author is quite unknown. We can hardly doubt but
that there were other English-Latin Dictionaries besides the
Promplorizcm and the Cafflaolicon, which have been lost, and this
opinion is the more probable, as both these appear to have been
compiled in the Eastcrn Counties, and it seems hardly probable
that other districts were behind their neighbours in the pro-
duction of these most necessary books.

It would be a curicus inquiry if we were able to learn how
these Dictionaries were compiled. In the case of Latin-English
Dictionaries there is no difficulty, as there were many sources
from which the words could be drawn, but it is different with
reg-ard to those in which the English is first, as we do not know

of the existence of any earlier list of English words than that
found in the Promptorium.

 

¹ The letter A in Promptorium contains 423 11701113, the Catlcolc'con only 2123
with the additions from the Addit. MS. there arc, however, 314 words.
