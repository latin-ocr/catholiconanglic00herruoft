Ι would especially draw attention to the very great similarity
which we find in many words between the Catholicon and the
Medulla, pointing clearly to the fact of a common origin.

ξ9. The authorities to which I have had recourse, and from
which my notes and illustrations have been drawn are set out in
the list at the end of this volume, but it may not be amiss here to
refer more fully to such of them as I have found more especially
useful. Amongst Dictionaries of the older English, Stratmann
and Matzner have been of the greatest value3 of the latter, un-
fortunately, I had no opportunity of consulting a copy until after
C had passed the press. Of the former Ι have made free use,
although, at the same time, endeavouring to gather together
illustrations and quotations not to be found there.

In Wrighffs Volume of Vocabularies, although it is far from
satisfactorily free from faults and mistakes, I have found an
almost endless source of illustrations of many words and of all
dates 2.

For later English my chief helps have been Huloet's Abeo-
(lm-im, Hor-man's Vulyaria (two most curious and interesting
merlis, which would well repay reprinting), Baret’s silerem-ie,
the Ortus soc-abulormnss, Levins' Blanipulm Vocabulomcm, Stan-
bridge I'oeabnla, Palsgiave, Cotgrave, and, in a lesser degree,
Coekeram‚ W ithals‚ Gouldman, and J amieson.

For the names of plants and instances of botanical terms I
have principally had recourse to Cockayne’s Leeelcdoms, Lyte's
translation of Dodoens, 'I‘urner’s and Gerarde’s Hel-hals, and the
several lists of plants in YVright's Volume of Vocabularies5 already
mentioned, besides numerous lists of plants in MSS.4 The Dic-
tionary of English tht-Names, compiled by Meser. Britten &

² A new edition, with large additions and. correction& and edited by Prof.
Wiilcker, is now in the press.

3 See Mr. KVay's Introd. p. liv. I have used the edition of 1532.

⁵ Mr. Vr'ay gives a list of several, Introd. p. lxvii, and many more might he men-
tioned. Why should not one of our Societies print a· collection of some, at least7
of the numerous gloss-aries still remaining in MS? The light which they would
help to throw on our languagc can not he over-estimatcd.
