⁸ In the Household and XVardrobe Ordinances of Edward II. (Chaucer Society‚ ed.
Furnivall). p. 45, it was directed that there should be attached to the court ‘ a ferr-etter,
who shal have ij few-retes and a boy to help him to take conies when he shal be so charged
bi the steward or thresorer. He shal take for his owne wages ijd a day ; for his boy jd

⁴ A. S. seor-m, what goes to the support of life ; feormicm, to supply with food, entertain.
‘ The modern sense of sarm arose by degrees. In the first place lands were let on condition
of supplying the lord with so many niffhts' entertainment for his household. Thus the
Saxon Chron. AD 775, mentions land let by the abbot of Peterborough, on condition that
the tenant should annually pay o650, and anes· w'htes feorme. one night's entertainment.
This mode of 160110111113Γ con<tantly appears in Domesday Book z——“ Reddet firmam trium
noctium 1 i. e. 100 libr.” The inconvenience of payment in kind early made universal the
substitution of a money payment, which was called firma alba, 01· blanche ferme, from being
paid in silver or white money instead of victuale. Sometimes the rent was called simply
firma, and the same name was given to the farm, or land from whence the rent aecrued.
From A. S. the word seems to have been adopted in Fr. ferme, a farm. or anythinu held
in farm, a lease.' XVedgwood. s. v. Farm. See also Liber Custumarum. Gloss. s. v. Firma.
In the Paston Lettersz, iii. 431, in a letter from Margaret Paston to her husband, we have
the word ferme used in its two meanings of rent ραίιῐ, and land renlecl. She writes—
‘ Please you to wet that Wssl. J eney and Debham carne to Calcote . . . . and ther they
spake with Rysyng and John Smythe‚ and haskyd hem rente and ferme . . . . . ‘⁶ Sir.”
quod Rysyng, ‘⁶ Ι toke the ferme of my master‚'' &c.' So in vol. i. p. 181, we find men-
tioned ‘ londs at Boyton weche Cheseman had in his ferum for v. ma1·k.' See also Morte
Arthure, ll. 425, 1005. Caxton, in the Chron. of Enylond, p. 281, ch. 242, says: ‘iiij
knyghtes hadden taken engloud to ferme of the kyngess
