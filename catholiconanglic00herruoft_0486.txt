‘Festnes es Laverd him dredand to,
And his wite-word [testamcntmn] pat he schewed in pos
Early Eny. Psalter, Ps. xxiv, 14.
In the Kirkton-in-Lindsay Church Aeoounts, under date 1513, is an item, ‘ Received for
Will. Briggs bereall and for his wyizcard ij. viij‹1.' The verb to wite=to bequeath occurs
very commonly in 15th and 16th century wills. Thus in the Test. E bor. iV. 41, in the W111
of Robert Pyukney, Chantry-priest at Hornby, in 1489, we read : ‘ for my mortum-y Ι wite
my best moveable. Also I wite v pund of wax to be burnyd at myn obiet. Also I wite to
evere preist dwellyng in Hornby forsaid viijd.’ And again, p. 77. in the Will of John Brown,
onork, 1492, ‘ I wita grete brasse pot to Seynt Anton gild, to be prayed for.’ ‘The
residue, my dettes paied and my witworde fulfilled, I wit to Richard WVynder, Pewterer,
and to Robert Preston, glasier.' Test. Ebor. iv. 88, Will of W. WVynter, 1493. ‘My
wytworrl fulfyssych then I will that my wyfe have hal the tone half) Will of John FerrHy,
1470, Τοῦτ. mor, iii. 180. In the York Hours of the Cross, pr. in the Lay-Follcs Maes-
Book, p. 86, l. 55, we read—-
‘At pe ‘cyme of none iesu gun cry, he wylle his saul to his fadyr.’

See the Editor’s note at p. 309.

² A week. A. S. wice, wuce. In the Cursor Mundi, 2857, is a curious legend about
Lot's wife, that ‘anes o pe wok day And Pan pai find hir on pe morn,

pan es seo liked al away, Hale als sco was ar be-forn3’
where the other MSS. have wake, wozzke, and ‘trihu see also 1. 11012; Morte Arllmrc, l.
3543 Tale of Ber-yn, 19 ; and the Knissht of La Tozm· Lamzdry, p. 12. Maundevine says
that ‘ in the Kyngdoms of Georgie, ofAhchaz and of the little Armenye, ben gode Cristene
menlancl devoute. For thei schryuen hem and howsele hem evermore ones or twyes iu
t1e Volso? . 261.
p ⁴ She drof forth hir dayes in hir depe thoght.
With weping and wo all ‘the wolce ouer.’ Destruet. of Troy, 499.
Barbour, in his Rruee, xiV. 132, has ‘ refresehit weill ane 0101»- or mair ;' where other MSS.
read wouh, (mlle, and 1116611),- and Lyndesay, Dreme, p. 284, ed. 1866, has—
‘He mycht pas round aboute, and cum agane,
In four 3eris, saxtene ozcllcz's, and dayis ‘two‚'

In the Ordinances of the Gild of St. George, Norwich, is one that ‘ ye pouer brother or
sister shall haue, iu ye wolfe, viijd.' Eny. Gilcls, p. 18. Trevisa, in his trans. of Higden's
account of Britain, says that ‘ here beep salt welles fer frain pee see, and beeth salte alle pe
wok-e longe forto Satin-day at none; and fresche fram Saturday ab 110116 for to Monday ;’ ii.
25 ; and again, V. 415, he says of ⁶ Seynt John pe Aumener, patriark of Alexandria‚' that
‘ he vsede twyes a woolce to sitte al day to fore pe chirche dore for to acorde men bat were
in stryf.' See also Genesis xxix. 28, and Exodus xxxiv. 22. The form walse occurs in the
Ormulztm, 4173. and Genesis ὣ Emodus, 2473. ‘Ape was the pharisee that with oute
shewede him clothed with bountee, counterfetinge that. he was juste and livede wel, and,
as he seyde, fastede twyes in the wolfe? De Deguileville's Pilyrimagye, p. 122. ⁵ Βίενείιιε,
the woke day. Ebclmnadas, a woke.’ Medulla.
