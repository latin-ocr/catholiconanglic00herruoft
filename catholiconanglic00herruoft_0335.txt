⁵ A Pele, according to J 8111185011, according to the proper sense of the term, was distin-
guished from a Castle, the former being wholly of earth. Such is the account given by
Lesly when describing the manners of the Scots borderers. The term occurs several times
in Barbour's Brace. Thus in Book x. l. 137, Linlithgow is described as
‘a peilb
Mekill and stark, and stuffit weill Vith ynglis men.’
888 also 11. 147. 152, 19 3, &c. Jamieson remarks that the site of this fortification at
Linlithgow is still called the Peel. Professor Skeat suggests that the source of the word
may be the Gaelic peillic, a hut made of earth and branches, and covered with skins.
Wyntoun in his ΟΙινοηὶεἰε, VIII. xxviii. 94, says—-

See also Wallaee, iv. 213. In Robert of Brunne, p. 157, the term is applied to a wooden

Hoas of Fame, 1. 1310 : ‘ God saue the lady of thys pel! Ducange gives ⁶ Pela, Castellum,
arx, Anglis Pile vel Pille‚’ and quotes from Rymer's Foedera, viii. 95, a charter of Henry
IV. dated 1399, granting to the Earl of N orthumberland the ¹ castrum, Pelam, et dominium
de Man‚' whence Peel the chief town of that island derives its name.
