on which the editor notes—-‘ Granqe is a French word, meaning properly a barn, and was
applied to outlying farms belonging to the abbeys. The manual labour on these fal-ms
was performed by an inferior class of monks, called lay—brothers, who were excused from
many of the requirements of the monastic rule (see Fleu1y‚Eccles. Hist.), but they were
supen‘ntended by sshe monks themselves, who were allowed occasionally to spend some
days ab the Giange for that purpose. See Schipmaome' ε Tale.' At the Reformation many
of the Monasteries were turned into Gr tn es: thus 111 Skelton' 5 Colir C'lout we read—
