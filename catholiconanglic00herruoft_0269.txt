¹ In the Morte Arnum-e, l. 419, Arthur bids the messenger
‘ Gret wele Lucius, thi lorde‚ 3,“(1 layne noghte thise wordes ε’

and again, 1. 2593, Sir Gawayne asks the strange knight to tell his name, and ‘layna
noghte the sothe.’ See also william of Palerne, H. 906, 918, and 1309. &a The p. p.

leym«. Ray (Gloss. of North Country WVords) gives ‘Lean‚ vb. “ to Zean nothing‚’' to con-
ceal nothing 3' and ‘Lamiam sb. “ they will give it no Ζειη6ἱ119,” i. e. they will divulge it.'
A common expression in the old romances is ⁸ the sothe is not to layne‚’ i. e. ‘ the truth is
not to be hid? In the A vowynqse of Kynss Α rtlmr, st. lxx. appears the proverbial expression,
‘mete laynes mony lakke! ‘ Wil i noght leyne mi priuite.’ Cursor alandi, 2738.

Sythyn, rost hom on gredyL and grynde Do 110 Zampreyes and serve hit in sale ;’
and on p. 38 is another receipt for ‘ lamprayes bakun.’ In the Hengrave Household
Accounts is this enti-y, ‘ for presenting a lamprcy pye vjd) ‘ Item, the xiiij day of Janu-

to Job, p. 671, says : ‘ Also forsothe al the boc anent the Ebrues is seid derc and slidery,

thing is spoken and other thing is don ; as is thou woldest an eel or a Iaumprtm holde

first a Lampron Grigg, then a Lampret, then a Lamprell, then a Lamprey. A Lamprmz,
first a Bafle, then a Barling, then a Lamprell, and then a. Lamprey or Lampron.’ ‘ Lam—
prons and Lampreys differ in bigness only and in goodness ; they are both a very sweet
and nourishing meat . . . . The little ones called Lamprons are best bross’d, but the great
ones called Lampreys are best baked.’ Muffett, pp. 181, 3. See also Household Ord. p.
