We find the word also used for the handle of the plough. that by which it is guided,
which, judging from the latin equivalent, is most probably the meaning here (see
Plewghe handyne, above). Thus in the Invent. of Robert Prat, taken in 1562, we
find ‘one hande sawe, one horse loke xvjd„ ij plewghes, j culter, on soeke, iijS. iiij ¹.‚ xxij
fellowes, v donge forckes, x pleughe heads, vi plewe sheares, ij stereires, foure showells‚ two
