PREFACE. xi

tude betweene the good scholers and diligent bees in gathering
their wax and hony into their hive) I called then their Alvearie‚
both for a memoriall by whom it was made, and also by this
name to incourage other to the like diligence, for that they
should not see their worthy prayse for the same, unworthily
drowned in oblivion.' To come down to rather later times, it
may be mentioned, in conclusion, that Thomas Willis, a school-
master of Isleworth‚ named his Dictionary, 1651, Vestibulum.

Mr. WVay has given a most full and careful account of the early ι

Dictionaries in the Preface to his edition of the Promptorz'um,
and I may, perhaps, be allowed to draw the attention of those
interested in Lexicographical history to my ‘Chronological
Notices of the Dictionaries of the English Langnage ¹.'

It is hardly necessary now to enlarge upon the value of these
old Dictionaries, as that is very generally allowed, but I cannot
resist giving an instance of how the Promptorz‘mn has settled
satisfactorily the etymology of a difficult name. When Mr.
Alderman Hanson, F.S.A.‚ was investigating the history of
various fruits, he was somewhat puzzled by the term ‘Jordan
almonds'v applied to the best kind of sweet almonds‚ and he
set to work to look up the authorities. He found a definite
statement in Phillips's New World of Words (6th ed. by Kersey,
1706), to the effect that ‘the ,„tree grows chiefly in the.
Eastern countries‚ especially 111 the Holy Land near the river
Jordan, whence the best of this fruit are called “Jordan
almonds.’'' The same statement is made in Bailey's Dictionary
111 1757 (the botanical portion of which was edited by no less a
person than Philip Miller), and in many other books. In J.
Smith's Bible Plants ( Ι 877) we read, ‘the best so-called Jordan
almonds come from Malaga, and none now come from the
country of the Jordan.’ The author might very well have
added that they never did come from that place. The mer-
chants of Malaga‚ who export the almonds, are equally at sea
as to the derivation. One of them told ΜΓ. Hanson that the
general opinion was that a certain Frenchman, called J ourdain,
early in this century, introduced an improved method of culti-
vation. This suggestion was easily negatived by reference to
