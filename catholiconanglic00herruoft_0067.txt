¹ In the XI Pains of Hell, pr. in An Old Eny. Miscellany, p. 219, l. 280, our Lord is
represented as saying—‘Of aysel and gal 3e 3euen me drenkyn3’ and in the Roma‘tmt
of the Rose, l. 217, we read—

‘That lad her life onely by brede, Kneden with eisell strong and egre.'

In the Ferme Qf’Cury, p. 56, is mentioned ‘ Aysell other alegar.¹ Roquefort gives ‘aisih
vinegar! In the Manip. Vocab. the name is spelt ‘ ΑΕΒΖ] and in the Reg. MS. 17, c. xvii,
‘ aysyl.' In Mirc's Instructions to Parish Priests, p. 58, 1. 1884 we find, ‘Loke by wyn be
not eysel.' A. S. eis-ele, aisil.

² Lyte in his edition of Dodoens, 1578, p. 746, says of Oak-Apples z—-‘ The Oke-Apples
01· greater galles, being broken in sonder, about the time of withering do forshewe the
sequell of the yeare, as the expert husbandmen of Kent haue observed by the liuing
thinges that are founde within them: as if they finde an Ante, they iudge plentie of
grayne: if a white worme lyke a gentill, morreyne of beast: if a spider, they presage
pestilence, or some other lyke sicknesse to folowe amongst men. Whiehe thing also the
learned haue noted, for Matthiolus vpon Dioscorides saith, that before they be holed
or pearsed they conteyne eyther a F lye, a Spider, or a WVorme 2 if a Flye be founde it is
a pronostication of warre to folowe: if'a creeping worme, the scarcitie of victual: if a
Γυξῖιὲξῐῗξιῗίῗέ)Ηέῗίξζῖθεξωὲῖἲξὲνῗιτοξὲθῗξέ, warch, paine, smart.’ Cotgrave. Baret points
out the distinction in the spelling of the verb and noun: ‘Ake is the Verbe of this
substantive Ache, Ch being turned into K: Cooper in his Thesaurus, 1584, preserves the
same distinction. Thus he says—‘ Dolor capitis, a headache: dolet caput, my head akes.'
sse pt. t. appears as οἶσε in P. Plowman‚ B. xvii. 194 ; in Lonelich’s Hist. of the Holy Grail,
ed. Furnivall, and in Robert of Gloucester, 68, 18. A. S. acan.

⁴ ‘Alablasm-ites. Alabaster‚ sounde especially aboute Thebes in Egipte! Cooper.

⁵ ‘promptas Aias ffor velany.' Medulla.

⁶ The following account of the origin of the name of Albania is given by Holinshed,
Chronicles, i. leaf 39b, ed. 1577 :—‘ The third and last part of the Island he [Brutus]
allotted vnto Albanacte hys youngest sonne ..... This latter parce] at the first toke
the name of Albanactus, who called it Albania. But now a small portion onely of the
Region (beyng vnder the regiment of a Duke) reteyneth the sayd denominatim, the
reast beyng called Scotiande, of eertayne Scottes that came ouer from Ire-land to inhabite
in those quarters. It is diuided from Lhoegres also by the Humber, so that Albania, as
Brute left it, conteyned all the north part of the Island that is to be found beyond the
aforesayd streame, vnto the point of Cathenesse.' Cooper in his Thesaurus gives, ‘ Scotim
Scotlande: the part of Britannia from the ryuer of Tweede to Catanes.'
