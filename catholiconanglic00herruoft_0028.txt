xviii INTRODUCTION.

disagreeable task. Most of the books written previously to
the middle of the 15th century had, of course, been already
read by Stratmann, hsatzner, and others, but all of a later
date I had to read through myself, as well as all belonging
to the earlier period which had been printed by 1116 various
Societies since the publication of those dictionaries.

of Mr. Way’s quotations or remarks on any word, except for
some special reason. This will to a great extent account for
the fact that after the letter P my notes become much more
frequent and full. It· is much to be regretted that Mr. WVay
was unable to annotate the third part of the Promptorium
(from R to the end) as fully as he had the preceding letters.
There are many, very many, words in this third part of the
greatest interest and importance to the student and philologist,
and well deserving of the same careful and learned treatment
as was bestowed by the editor on the letters A—R. And not
a few words, too, are difficult 10 understand, and perhaps almost
unintelligible to the ordinary reader without a note.

It will be readily seen that the annotation of the two works
has been carried out on very different lines. Mr. YVay, from
his apparent-ly inexhaustible store of arehaeological lore, has
enriched the Promptorium with notes and quotations bearing
rather on the history of that which is represented by the word,
than upon the history of the word itself as shown by its use 111
various authors, while my notes are almost entirely devoted to
the latter object.

I have endeavoured to be especially caresul about the correct-
ness of the quotations and references, feeling that on this depends
a great deal of their value. But in a work of this kind, in
which so many hundreds of quotations are brought together,
mistakes can not be entirely avoided, and I can only trust that
their number is comparatively infinitesimal.

The experience which I have gained as Assistant—Editor of the
Philological Society‘s new English Dictionary of the trouble, the
vexation caused by, nay, even the almost absolute worthlessness
of quotations the references to which are either imperfectly or
incorrectly given, has taught me the extreme importance of
correctness and fulness in this particular. I'nfortunately my
