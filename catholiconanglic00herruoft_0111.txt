The Middle English form was boteler, boner,

as in Wyclif, Genesis xl. 1, 2. Ducange gives the form baudarius as occurring in the

Laws of Malcolm II of scotland, 0. 6, ξ 5.

The word is derived from the Norm. Fr.

butuiller from L. Lat. bota, or butta, a butt, 01· large vessel of wine, of which the buticu-
larius (bouteicler, or butler) of the early French kings had charge. So the botiler of the
English kings took prisage of the wines imported, one cask from before the mast, and one
from behind. Butt in later times meant a measure of 126 gassons, but originally it was
synonymous with dolium 01· tun. Boutez'lle is a diminutive from bucca ,· and the ⁶ buttery¹

is the place where the butue were kept.
