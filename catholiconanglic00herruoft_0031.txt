illustrated by quotatious from the Wills and Inventories pub-
blished by the Surtees Society, and from Henry Best's Farming
and Account Book. Many of these, such as Rea-ande, Spene, Bery,
Semi-sle, Ῐιεζῃ, δίαίΝι, illesam-op, and others, are peculial· to York-
shire, or at least to the most northern eounties.

The Addit. MS. appears to have been originally written in
a purcr northern dialect than Lord Monson's MS„ but it has
constantly been altered by the scribe. This is shown by the
order in which we find the words, Thus Spoyn was no doubt
originally written szme, as is clear from its position. Again
we have ‘ Scho’ or ‘ ΗΟ ’ in A., where Lord Monson's MS.
reads ‘ Sche.’

The thorn letter ]) is found not unfrequently throughout the
work, but does not occur as the· initial letter of a set of words:
instead of it words beginning with tle are given in the regular
alphabetical order under Τ.

As in the Promptorium, the Scribe has not been consistent in
his use of the thorn letter: frequently we find instead of it- the
y which not long after entirely superseded it. Occasionally we
even meet with the two forms in the same line.

Sele is used for sle, and 3σί for sl, but not invariably.

§8. The MS. of the Medulla Grammatiee, of which, by the
kindness of the authorities of St. John's College, Cambridge, Ι
have been enabled to make such free use, is that referred to by Mr.
VVay at p. liii of his Introduction. It is a 4to MS. belonging to
St. J ohn’s College, Press Mark C. 22, on paper quires, with vellum
covers to each quire. Thus the first two leaves are vellum, then
come five leaves of paper, followed by two leaves of vellum, five of
paper, and so on. At the end is the date, in the same handwriting
as the body of the MS„ 16th December, 1468. It is a Latin
Dictiona1·y,the explanation of the words being mainly in Latin ¹.
It was presented to the College by Thomas, Earl of Southampton,
and is stated to have been purchased from William Crashawe, a
brother of the poet, who was admitted fellow of St. John’s in
1593. I have also at times consulted other MSS. of the Medulla,
such as MSS. Harl. 1000, 1738, 2257, and 2270, but all the illus-
trations from the Medulla, which will be found in my notes, have
