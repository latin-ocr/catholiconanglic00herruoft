³ A stay is properly the male of any animal: cf. Stegge = gander. ‘ Stag, a colt, a young
cock.’ Peacock’s Gloss. of hlanley, &e. ‘ Pullus, the younge of everything ; a foale; a
chicken.’ Cooper. The word 15 generally taken as meaning a young horse ‘ under 3 years
old,’ but the following quotations from the Wills ὡ Ina-ent. vol. i. disprove this. Probably
itis an unbroken horse, for though R. Claxton bequeaths ‘ an ambling Stagg‚' yet one mode
of teaching a young horse to amble was to strap his fore and hind legs together while he
was yet in the field and before he was broken, and thus let him teaeh himself. The word
certainly had no reference to colour or sex, nor, I think, to any particular age. They might
.be old enough to breed from ; thus John Sherwode in 1533 bequeathed to Isabel his wife

in Ireland is Hayqarcl or Hayyartle=hay garth, which we also find as a not unusual
surname.
