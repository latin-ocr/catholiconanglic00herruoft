d'zcn edifices The description seems to answer to our word pilos. Halliwell gives
‘ Brandrith. A fence of wattles or boards, &c.’ We have already had loramentmn as the
Latin equivalent of a Bande of a howse. The catholicon explains loramentum to mean
boarding 01· fran1e·work compacted together. ‘Lm-amentum (concatenatio lignorum), gront-
festunge, gruntucst von lloltz geschlagen.’ Dief. Compare Key, or knyttyng of ij wallys

¹ apparently an error for Brandych : Ι know of no instance of the spelling Branych;
but the Medulla has ⁴ (fibro. To brauncbyn‚ or shakyn.‘ Cf. also P. Brawndeschyn
(brawnclzyn a* man K).
² ‘El-ent. High, straight, upright, smooth, not wrinkled.’ It mos-t frequently occurs in
one peculiar applzcation, in connection with braic, as denoting a high forehemh as distin-
guished from one that is flat.' Jamieson. In this sense it is used by Burns in ‘John
Anderson, my Jo,' where we find ‘Your bonnie brow was brevit! A. S. braun, O.Icel
brattr. See HalliwelL sm. Erant.
³ Armour for the arms. In Aschenss, Toxophilus (Arber's reprint, pp. 107, 108), we
find the following paesazge: ⁴ PHI. Which be instrumentes [of sllotynge]2 TOX. Braeer,
shotynge-glove, st1·ynge‚bowe and shafte . . . . A brac-er serueth for two causes, one to
saue his arm from the strype of the strynge‚ and bis doublet from wearynge, and the other
is, that the strynge glydynge sharpelye and quicklye of the braeer may make the sharper
shoote! Chaucer, Prologue to Cant. Troes, 1 11, describing the Yeoman, says—-
‘Upon his arm he bar a gay bracer,
And by his side a swerd and a bokeler.'
In the Blorte Arthure (E. E. Text Soc.9 ed. Broc-k), 1. 1859, in the fight with the king of
Syria, we are told that ‘Bt-asers- burnyste briste3 in sondyre;' see also l. 4247. Baret
gives ‘a bracem hrachialc⁷‚’ and in the Manip. Vocab. we find ‘a bracher, brachiale?
‘ Braclcale. A Vmbras) Medulla. ⁵ Brasselet, a bracelet, wristbamL 01· bracer.' Cotgrave.
See also Florio, s. v. Braeciale. ‘ Brache'ale. Torques in brachio, dextrale3 bracclet!
Ducange. ‘Brachiale A bracellette3 also a bracer.' Cooper. See also Brace, above, and
P. YVarbrace.
¹ ‘ Alle his clothes brozcded up and down.' Chaucer, Monke's Tale, 3659. In the Inven-
tory of Sir J. Fastolf’s goods, amongst the eloths and dress occurs ‘j pece of rede satyne,
brandan with {Icefcumtferel Paston Lettem, ed. Gardner‚ i. 477. ⁶ Browdyn. Embroidered.
Broudster. An embroiderer.’ Jamieson. See also Brothester. In Cotgrave we find
‘ Brocler. To imbroyder. Brode'. Imbroydered.' See also Barbour's Bruee, ed. Skeat, xi.

⁵ ‘ ,Masculus A muscle or fleashie parte of the bodie compacte of fleash, veines, sinewes
and artefice, seruyng especially to the motion of some parte of the bodie by means of the
sinewes in it. Muscalosas. Harde and stiffe with many musoles or brawnes of harde and
compacte fleash.’ Cooper. Chaueer, in the Prologue to the Canterbury Tales, 546, tells
us that ⁴ The Melle-re was a stout carl for the nones,
Ful big he was of braun, and eek of boones.’
and in the Legende of Goode Women, Dido, 1. 14 5, Encas is described as of
‘a noble visage for the noones,
And formed wel of brawnes and of boones.'
