¹ ⁴ Cruefflsm. To crucifien 01· to ffest to cros) Medulla. The phrase to ‘ do on the cross ’
for crucifying, putting to death on the cross. is very common in early English. See for
instance Myrc's Instructions to Parish priests, p. 14, l. 437, where, in a metrical version
of the Creed, we find— ‘ Sofl'rede peyne and passyone, And οη Pe cros ‘was I—done :⁴
and in Lonelich's Hist. of the Holy Grail, ed. Furnivall, xlix. 313-

‘ Of a virgine to be born with-owten offens, And sethen on eroys idon.y

⁴ Dey did him πρωὶ the erosse, and spette on his face, and bufletid him? Gesta Rom„ p. ¹79.

That well agree withouten breach or jars Spenser, Epithal 129.

‘ A croud (fiddle). Vielless Sherwood. In the Harleian M S. trans. of Higden, vol. ii. p. 379,
we find, ‘ a instrumente callede chorus, other a chore, was founde in Grece, of fewe cordes
and stlynges, whiche is callede now a crowtlze or a crowde.‘ Wycfif, lVorks, ed. Arnold,
ii. 73. says ⁴ symphonye and cromlc wereu herd whanne apostlis knewen alle wilatis.¹ See
Wedgwood S. v. ‘H ic simbolz'sator, AC& crowde. Simbolz'sare, to crowde or scotnyg. Hic
corallus, 21⁶⁶· crowdere. Hec corolla, Ace. crowde.’ MS. Reg. 17, cxvii. lf. 43, back. See
Lybeaus Disc. 1. 137, and Lyric Poetry, ed. Wright, p. 53. It will be seen that Mr. Way
has misread the present MS. in his note to this word in the Promptorium.

⁴ ‘ Fiola. A cruet. Amula. A Fyol or a cruet.’ Medulla. ‘ A cruet, a holie water stocke,
Amalec? Baret. In the Inventory of Sir John Fastolf’s goods at Caistor‚ 1459, amongst

crud,cu1·d or curdle. CailIer. Cruds οι· curds. Oaillae, Caillat? Sherwoosl. Lyte, Dodoens,
p. 246, says that Garden Mint ‘is very good to be applied vnto the breastes that are
stretched foorth and swollen and full of lnilke, for it slaketh and sostenetb the same, and
keepeth the mylke from quarring and crmldiny in the brest ;' and again, p. 719, he tells
us that the juice of figs ‘ turneth milke and oauseth it to crutide, and againe it scattereth,
or dissolueth. or melteth the clustered crucicle, or milke that is come to a crudele, as
