INTRODL'CTION. XXV

§IL In the preceding pagos Ι have endeavoured to explain
clearly the plan on which Ι have carried out this work, and thc
sources on which I have drawn for the notes. That the work
⁴will be found in every way satisfactory is far beyond my
expectations. That deficiences and short-comi1‘1gs will most
disagreeably make themselves evident in some places, =and
excess in others is, Ι sear, unavoidable in a work of this kind3
and Ι can only lay it before the Societies with a confident hope
that, despite its failings, it will be found of value for the number
and variety of the illustrations collected together in it. The
work was originally intended for the member-s of the Early
English Text Society only, the Council of the Camden Society
having some years ago determined not to follow up the joint
publication of Levins’ Illam'pzcln-s· [henham-mn. When, however,
about half of the Cathole'eon had passed the prcSS, the proposal
to join in its production was made to the Camden Society, and
it is a source of very great gratification to me that the Council
of the Society which printed the Promplorium has recognized the
present volume as a worthy companion to Mr. Way's admirable
work. It has occupied my leisure now for more than three
yearS, and in parting with it Ι seem to part with an old friend,
whose welfare and progress have so largcly occupied my thoughts
during that time. It would have been better for the Societies
had Mr. Wheatley been able to find time in his busy life to write
a longer introduction to this work, but as it is, I can only com-
mend the book to the impartial judgment of the members of the
two Societies, in the words of the original compiler himself: ‘ Si
qua in ea reprehensione digna invenerint, aut corrigant, aut oculis
clausis pertranseant, aut saltem humane ignorancie imputent.’
