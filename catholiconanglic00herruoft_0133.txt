¹ The corn-cockle. Agyrostemma yilhaqo. Gaelic coyall. Tares, husks, the corn-cockle.
Gockle or Ookyl was used by Wyelif and other old writers in the sense of a weed generally.
but in later works has been confined to the gith or corn-pink. ‘Coqm‘ol. A degenerate
barley or weed commonly growing among barley, and called Havcr—grasse.’ Cotgrave.
¹ Ζίἐαηηίἀ. Dravke⁷ or darnel, or eokkyl.’ Medulla. ‘ Coclcole hath a large smal [sic] leafe
and wyll beare v or vi floures purple colloure as brode as a. grote, and the sede is rounde
and blacke! Fitzherbert‚ Boke of Husbandry. See also Darnelle.
² Tusser in his Five Hundred Pointes‚ &c.‚ 92, 4, says-
‘Some cockneies with ecch-inq are made vel-ie fooles,
fit neither for prentise‚ for plough, nor for schooles ;'
and again 95, 5-—
‘Cockivy Mams and shifting Dads from schooles,
Make pregnant wits to prooue vnlearned fooles.'
‘A cockney, a childe tenderly brought up ; a dearling. Cockering‚ mollis illa educatio
quam indzclqentiam vocamus. A father to much cockering, Pater nimis inclulqens? Bareffs
Alvearie. Cooper gives ‘ Mammotlz reptas ,· after S. Augustine a childe that sucketh longe,
but Erasmus taketh it for a childe wantonly brought vp. Delio-ise .· a minion boye3 a
cockney; a wauton?
³ ‘Archonius: acervus mcmzimclorum. Manipulzcs. A gavel (sheaf of corn).’ Medulla.
‘A hay eocke. DIeta ferri) Withals. See also Mughe.
ί *ῙΙῙίἰίιιΊη. A mastiue’s colar made of leather wir-h nayles.' Cooper. ⁴ Milus. An houndys
colere! Medulla.
⁵ Men were djvided into four classes, according to their humours. Laurens Andrewe
says, in his Noble Lyfe, ‘ And the bodij of man is made of many diuers sortes of lymmes
as senewes, vaynes, fatte, flesshe ἃ, skynne. And also of the foure moistours, as sanguyne,
flematyke, coleryke Sc n1elancoly.' (fol. aiv. back. eol. 2). Men die, he says, in three
ways: 1. by one of the four elements of which they are made, overcoming the others;
2. by humidum radicale, or ‘naturall moystour‚’ forsaking them; 3. by wounds-—‘ the
coleryke commeth oftentymes to dethe be accedentall maner through his hastines, for he
is of nature hot and drye.' So also John Russell in his Boke of Nurturc (Babees Boke.
p. 53), says— ‘The second course colericus by callynge
Fulle of Fyghtynge blasfemynge, δι brallynge,
Fallynge at veryaunce with felow and fere!
And he adds these lines— Colericus.
Hirsuta& Fallax, irascens, modique, satis audax,
Asinius, yracilis, siccus, croceique coloris.
See also Dan Michel’s Ayenbite of Inwyt, ed. Mortis, p. 157.
⁶ See also Coriandre. ⁷ MS. which reads Cokylle‚ corrected by A.
⁸ Hampole in the Pricke of Conscience, 644, 3, tells us that
‘Aue erthe by skille may likned be The whiche in myddes has a colke,
Tine a rounde appel of a tree, As has an eye [egg] in myddes a yolke :‘
And in the Towneley MysterieS, p. 281, we read—
· It is fulle roten inwardly At the colkc within.'
