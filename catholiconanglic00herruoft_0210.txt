Α pastoral speech, a speech of the goatherd.' Gouldman. Compare &penser' 3 explanation
of the word ς ⁶ AEGLOGUE. They were first of the Greekes, the inventours of them, called
Aeqloyai, as it were Aeyon, or Aegyinonzon loni, that is, Goteheardes tales. For although
in Virgil and othsrs the speakers be more Shepheards then Goatheards, yet Theocritus, in
whom 13, more ground of authoritie then in virgil, This specially from That deriving, as
from the first heade and wellspring, the whole invention of these Acylogytces, maketh Goate-
heards the persons anal authors of his tales. This being, who seeth not the ι(11·1133110330 of
euch as by colour of learning would make us beleeve, that they are more rightly tearmed
Ecloyai. as they would say, extraordinarie discourses of unnecessztrie matter'.2 which
definition albe in substance and meaning it agree with the nature of the thing, yet no
whit answereth with the analysis and interpretation of the worde. For they be not tearmed
thyynes, but Aeyloyzces ,· which sentence this Authour verie well observing, upon good
iudgement, though indeede fewe Goatheards have to doe herein, neverthelesse doubteth
not to call them by the used and best known nalne.' Shepheards Calender. Generall
Argument, 106. Compare Foule speche, above.
