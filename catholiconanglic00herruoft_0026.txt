as an instance of the applieation of the term ‘conquestus' to the
accession of Henry V H.

The principal authorities cited in the work are, as Mr. YVay
says, Virgil, Ysidore, Papias, Brito, Hugutio, the Catholieon,
the Doctrinale, and the Gloss on the Liber Equivocorum of
John de Garlandia, but only Hugutio and the Liber Equivocorum
occur at all frequently. A large number of hexameter verses
occur, probably, as Mr. YVay suggests, from some work of John
de Garlandia. The meaning of some of them is not at all clear.

The compiler frequently distinguishes with great acumen
between the various shades of meaning of the several Latin
equivalents of some one English word.

ξς). The Addit. MS. 15,562, is a small quarto volume on paper
containing originally probably 145 leaves, of which one has been
lost at the beginning, as already stated. It is also defective at
the end, the last word in it being Wrathe, so that probably two
leaves have been lost at the end. It is written in a small and, at
times, rather cramped hand. Spaces are frequently left vacant
in the letters for additions of words. It was purchased by the
Museum at Newman's sale in 1845. Though not so correct as
Lord Monson's MS. it has at times helped 10 an elucidation of
some difficulties, and the correction of some errors in the latter.
A considerable differ-enee of opinion appears to have existed as to
the (late of the MS. as stated in ξῑ. Mr. KVay assigned it to
1450, while Halliwell, who in the second volume of his Archaio-
Dictimwry, frequently quotes from the Addit. MS„ refers to it
sometimes as ‘MS Dietionary, dated 1540 ξ’ sometimes as ςΜδ.
Dictionary, 1540 2,’ at other times as ‘MS Diet. e. 1500 ³,' and
again as ⁴ Cathol. Angl. MS.4.'

the collatioris of A. Ι have not thought it necessary to give
every variation of spelling; the omissions, however, are very few
in number, and only occur where the differenee in spelling is
very trifling. The order in which the words are arranged is
not the same in the two MSS„ nor are the Latin equivalents
