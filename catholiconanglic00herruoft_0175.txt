¹ The primary meaning of elde is age simply, as in La3amon‚ 25913„

‘Aelde haefde heo na mare

Buten fihtene 3ere.’

Compare ‘ All be 110 neuir sa. young off eilcl! Barbour's Bruce, xii. 322 ; and again ibid.
xx. 43, where we read how Robert's son David, who was but five years of age, was betrothed
to Joan of the Tower ‘ that than of eilrl had sevin 3er.’ Cf. Loneliol1⁷s Holy Grail, xxii.

sense of old aye, as in ‘ And if Ι now begyne in to myne elcl) Lancelot of the Lait, ed.

‘ Men schulde wedde aftir here astaat, For θεῖά and youthe ben often at debaat:
A. S. eald, ald. Compare Eueneldes.

² Used in both senses ofyr-andfaiher andfatlzer-in-law .· see Jamieson. Ray in his Glossary
of North Country Words gives ‘ Elmotlzer, a stepmother, Cumberland.' In Barbour’s Bruce,
ed. Skeat, xiii. 694, we are told that the king married his daughter to Walter Stewart,

‘ And thai weill soyne gat of thar bed Callit Robert, and syne was king

that he ⁴ was born He had his eldmoder maiden-hede,

Bath his father and moder be-forn ; And at his erthing all lede.’

Wyclif, &Vorks5 i. 181, sayS, ‘a child is ofte lyk to bis fadir or to his modir, or ellis to his
eelde fadir‚’ and again in the Prol⁴ to Eccles. p. 1 23, he speaks of ‘ myn elclefather Jhesus.’
La3am0n also uses the word fora grandfather: ‘ He wes Maerwale’s fader, Mildburye‚' iii.
246. See also Chaucer‚ Boethius p. 40, and E. Enq. Metrical Homilies, ed. Small, p. 122.
Cf. also G. Douglas, Eneados, Bk. vi, p. 195, l. 26, ed. 1710, where it is used to translate
socer, and at p. 55, l. 43, he speaks of Hecuba as ⁴ eldmoder to ane hnnder.’ ‘ Avia. An
eld modere. Socrus. An e[l]de modere.’ Medulla. ³ See also Olyfaunte.

says: ‘The fayre bath chaunged my chylde. Strix, ‘cel lamia pro meo suam paruulum,
supposuit! In Aelfric’s Glossary, Wright’s Vol. of vocab. p. 60, we have elf used as
equivalent to the elassical nymph .· thus we find ‘ oreada, munt-aelfen ; Dryade& wudu-
