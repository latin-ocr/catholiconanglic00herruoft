XXlV INTRODECTION.

1645. A very slight glauce will show to what a great extent
this work has helped to throw light on many of t-lie dialeetal
terms and forms in the Catholieon. For purposes of quotation,
indeed, it has been a more satisfactory book than the Wills ᾇ
Inventm·2'e.s·, as the extracts in most cases help to explain them-
selves, instead of being a mere list of names, Several other
publieations of the same Society have also furnished a valuable
and welconie quota of illustratione, more especially the Townley
Mysteries and the Early English Psalter. Nor should I omit to
mention the excellent reprints of Prof. Arber, as remarkable for
their correctness as their cheapneSS.

Such have been my main resourees for the earlier and dialectal
illustrations of the words in the Catholicon: for more modern
uses, Prof. Skeat's and Mr. V'edgwood's Etymological Dic-
tionaries have been of the greatest service‚ while for Scotch
words and forms Ι have used Jamieson’s Dictionary.

ξΙΟ. And now my task is done, with the exception of one
pleasant duty, that of returning thanks to those gentlemen who
have in various ways assisted me during the progress of the work.
The chief thanks both of the Societies and of myself are of course
due to Lord Monson for his great kindness in lending this valu-
able MS. freely and willingly, without any restriction as to time,
for so many years

Next our thanks are due to Prof. Mayor and the authorities of
St. John's College, Cambridge, for the willingly-granted loan of
their MS. of the Medulla, and to Mr. Η. B. VVheatley for his
very interesting Preface.

My own thanks are especially due to Mr. H. Hucks Gibbs⁷
first, for kindly lending me his set of the publications of the
Surtees Society‚ of which I have made so large a use in my
notes; and secondly, for assistance in the explanation of several
words, which had long puzzled others as well as myself. To
Mr. Furnivall and Mr. J. H. Hessels I an] similarly indebted,
for help in my hunt after the origin aud meaning of a large
number of words3 while from Prof. Skeat I have, as ever,
always received a ready aid. In especial I am deeply indebted
to Mr. lYedgwood, who has kindly found time to read over a
large proportion of the work in proofi and by his suggestions
and help has contributed not a little to its value‚
