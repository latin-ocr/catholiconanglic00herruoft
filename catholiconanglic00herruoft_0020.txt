X l'REFACJ-L.

The names attached to the old Dictionaries are curious and
worthy of a passing notice here. They give a distinetive
character to the several works, which the works would not
possess if they were called by the general title of Dictionary.
‘promptuarium’ is a more correct form than ‘Promptoriumj
and means a storehouse or repository. ll'ynky'n de KVorde uses
this word iu his edition, but Pynson and one of the manuscripts
have Promptorius. J ohannes de J anua, or Januensis‚ a native of
Genoa. in the thirteenth century, appears to have been the first
to use the word Catholicon as the title for a Dietionary. His
work was very highly esteemed, and it was a very natural pro-
ceeding for the unknown English lexieographer to appropriate
so well known a title. A catholicam* Parvvm„ the first printed
Latin and F renel] Vocabuhrry, was publishcd at Geneva in 1487,
and a few years afterwards appeared a Caflzolieecm Αὐὸνθτίιίίῑιηι at
Paris, which was reprinted by J ean Lambert at the same place
in 1506. The illedttlla Grammaliee or Grammaliees is a Latin-
Euglish Dictionary existing in a large number of manuscripts,
This is attributed to Geoffrey, the Dominican Friar who compiled
the Promptorium3 and if this really be so, this worthy must
extort our admiration as the author both of the first Latin-
English and the first English-Latin Dictionary. The first
Latin-English Dictionary printed in England is the Orfizcs
I'oeahnlornm, which is largcly founded on the Medulla. Another
‘interesting old Dictionary is the Vulqaria of William Horman.
Mr. Herrtage mentions this in his Introduction as a work that
would well repa-y reprinting, and I may remark here that the
lato Mr. Toulmin Smith undertook to edit this book for the
Early English Text Society‚ and in the Second Annual Report,
1866, it is announced with his name in the list of future publi-
cations. The death of this excellent worker in the midst of his
labour on the volume of Enylisla Gilds, however, caused this
Dictionary to be dropt out of the list in future yearS. Peter
Levins adopted the title of Blanijmlas J'oeabulormn for his inter-
esting old rhyming Dictionary, and John Baret gives his
reasons for calling· his Dictionary Aa Alcearie. He set his
scholars to work to extract passages from the classic& and to
arrange them under heads: ⁶ Thus within a- yeare or two they
had gathcrcd togethir a great volume, which (for the apt simili-
