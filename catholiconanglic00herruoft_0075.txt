‘It nas arettecl him no vyleinye,
Ther may no man clepe it no cowardye.'
According to Cowell a person 15 arettecl, ‘ that is covenanted before a judge, and charged

with a crime.'

In an Antiphon given for the ‘ Twesday Seruyce,' in The Myrrfflcre of Οιιν

Lady, p. 203, we read :—‘ Omnem solestatem. O mekest of maydens, we arecte to thy hye

we find amongst the duties of the Chamberlain—

In the Romaaut of the Rose we find asethe, the original French being assez: other forms
found are assyth, syth, siche. Jamieson has ‘to assyth, syitlc, 01· siclae, to compensate;
