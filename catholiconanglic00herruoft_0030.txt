ξ 7. It is a difficult matter in the case of a work of this class,
111 which we have only isolated words on which to base 311
opinion, to decide exactly as to the birth-place or dialect of
the author: and this difficulty is increased by the fact that
of the copies which have come down to us neither 111 311 proba—
bility is the autograph of the compiler, but the work of a scribe.

· We can, however> in the present instance assert with considerable

confidence that 1110 compiler was a native of one of the northern
counties. Mr. YVay was of opinion that the dialectical peculiarities
of the MS. indicated that 11 was compiled in the north-eastern
parts of Enghnd, and in this 110 was most probably correct.
He pointed cut that the names of Norwich, Lincoln‚ York,
Richmond‚ Ripon, Durham and Carlisle occur in it, but we
0311 hardly attribute much importance to this fact, inasmuch
as we also find London, Salisbury, Bath, Oxford, VVinchester,
and Cambridge—and these are all names of places which
would be likely to be familiar to a monk, and such I bc-
lieve the compiler to have been, grounding my opinion 011
1115 intimate knowledge of ecclesiastical terms, as evidenced
throughout the work, as well as on such slight, but, to my
mind, significant entries as didimus for vn-Trowabylle. The
mention of Hel-bem or Heekboafs is more to the purpose, as
these appear to have been peculiar to the river Ouse in
Yorkshire. So also with Scurffe, which appears to obtain prin-
cipally on the Tees 1. So again, we have the curious expression
Gabrielle mehe, which still exists 111 Yorkshire. Further, the
author speaks ot' the Wolds, Which he renders by Alpes. On the
whole it is probable that 1110 work was compiled 111 the north
portion of the East Riding of Yorkshire 2 more exactly 111311 11115
it is now impossible to fix the locality. The reader will notice
the large number of words occurring in our work, which are
