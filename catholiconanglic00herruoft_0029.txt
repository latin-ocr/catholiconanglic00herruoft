INTRODUCTION. xix

experience came too late for me to carry into practice in every
instance the fuluess of reference which I should now wish to
see. Ι have tried, therefore, to make up for this, as far as lay
in my power, hy giving as full and complete as possible a list
of the authorities quoted from, with particulars as to the editions
used, and the dates of the original works. The dates, although,
of course, in many cases only approximate, will, as I know from
experience, be found of great service, and should, in fact, be
always given in works of this kind. The time which it will
save to students, none but those who have had the trouble of
hunting up authorities as to the flate of a MS. can appreciate.

I much regret now that I did not from the beginning arrange
the quotations according to their chronological order of compo-
sition. The point did not occur to me until I began to use
Matzner's ll‘brlerbnele, when I at once recognised the mistake
into which we had both fallen, and the great ineonveniences
arising from it, although these inconveniences‚ owing to the
relatively small number of quotations given by me, will not, I
think, be so much felt as in the case of the fuller work.

It was also suggested to me that I should re-arrange the
words in their striet alphabetical order, but I do not see that
the advantageousness of such an arrangement is so apparent
as to call for the amount of time and labour involved in its
preparation. As a rule, the words are in a very close approxi-
mation to the strict alphabetical order, and I have therefore
contented myself with altering the position of such few words
as were by some accident inserted in the MS. a long way from
their proper position.

Ι have followed Mr. VVay's lead in endeavouring rather to
illustrate by contemporary or earlier quotations the words given
in the Catholic0n‚ than to enter on the difficult and dangerous
ground of etymologies.

§6 There are a few words of which, notwithstanding all my
exerffions, I have been unable to obtain any satisfactory expla-
nation. Such are ‘to Bacon; damoclem? ‘Bebybeke3’ ‘a
Byehdoghter3 eplaltes;’ ‘Blossom, colloqnintt'da ;' ‘to Blunder;
balandi0r¹;’ ‘to Calle a hawke3 §inpare ;’ ‘Common slaghter3
