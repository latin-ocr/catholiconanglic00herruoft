¹ In the Liber Albus, p. 631, we find a regulation ‘ that cloths of ray shall be 28 ells in
length, measured by the list, and 5 quarters in width.' See the Statute 1 1 Henry IV, c. 6.
The word occurs in P. Plowman, C. vii. 217, on which see Prof. Skeat's note. In the will
of Dame Eh'zabeth Brome, Pas-ton Letters, iii. 465, we find mentioned ‘iiij cortens, ij of

rayesl sarsenet, and two of grene?
