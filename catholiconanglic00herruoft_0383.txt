¹ ‘ A 5631116, scabies? Manip. Vocab. ⁴ A scab, or scabbednesse, a 56311, scabies: scabbed,
or full of sealles3 his head is all 10 scald.' Baret. In a poem on ΝΟΜ-16111118, circ. 1380,

pr. in Halliwell's Dict. p. 958, we read-
‘ Besydis the ere ther ben two, To kepe hys heved fro evyl turnyng

That on a man mot ben undo. And fro the scalde, wythout lesyng.'
See also another extract in his Introduction, under Worcester. Chaucer describing the
Sompnour 5395- ‘ Quyk he was, and ohirped as a sparwe

With skallecl browes blake, and piled berd.’ C. T. Prologue‚ 62 7.
‘ A scall, impetiqo! Coles. ‘ Glabra; sex-offe or 563116.Ἇ Wright’s Vol. of Vocab. p. 179.
‘ A malander . . . . appereth on 1116 forther legges, in the bendynge of the knee behynde,
and is like a scabbe or a skal.⁷ Fitzherbest, Boke of Husbandry, fo. G vibk.

2 See Holleke‚ above, p. 187. ‘A scallion onion, ascalonia! Baret. ‘Sam A Scal-
lion, a hollow or vuset Leeke.’ Cotgrave.

3 A scapulary, so called from its being thrown over the shoulders. In Wright’s Polit.
Poems, ii. 19, Jack Upland says : ⁶ What betokeneth your great hood, your scapha-ie, your
knotted gil-dle, and your wide eope 2’ In Pierce the Ploughman’s Crede, l. 550, it is said
of the friars 11131 ‘ pei schapen her ckapolories and strecchel) hem brode,

And launcep hei3e her hemmes wip babelyng in stretes?

⁴ The habyte of his ordre his eope hys scapularye and cote were all wythout ony euyl
corupcyon.' Caxton, Golden Lcycnde, lf. 419, 601. 4. In Holinshed, vol. 111. p. 830, the
word is used for a kind of 111311116, probably a monk’s cloak: ‘In the 1110116111 of Maie,
the king and the new duke of Suffolke were defendere at the tilt against all commers.
The king was 111 a scopelarz’e mantle, an hat of eloth of siluer, and like a white bennit!
This would appear to be the meaning intended in our text, as also in the Inventory give-u
111 Paston Letters, iii. 410. where we find ⁶ j scapelerey with 311 hedde? But from a passage
in the Ancren Bia-le, p. 424, it is evident 11131 11 was a very light cloak, for there is per-
mission given 10 anchoresses that ‘iuwid Pe wanes ha muhe werie scapeloris hwen mantel
ham heueaeoff

⁴ ‘ Spirfte called a hagge, a hobbegoblyn, which appeareth in the night. Larua, lemur.¹
Huloet. ‘Laraa, 3 sprite appearyng by night ; an begge3 a goblin ; a goast3 a visarde ς
0116 disguised! Cooper. ‘A bugge, spectrwn, lamed Baret. The Medulla explains larva
by ‘ a. Vesere or a skerell or a deuyl!

⁵ See the Secyn Sayes, 1. 1 ²44, where we read—-

⁴ That on was bothe curteis and kende, And that other lef to pinehe,
Les to give and lef 10 spende; Bothe he was scars and chinehe ;'
and Alisazmder, 101 2—
‘ Iu a castel heo was y-set, Skarschliche and nought foisoun.’

Wyclif in his Apoloygffi p. 105, says: ⁴ pei ken per tongis for to spek gret pingis, wan bei
do but litil bingis: pei are largist bihi3tars & παπ-1111 geuars? And again in his version
of 2 Cor. ix. 6: ‘ He that soweth scarsly, schal and scarslgs repe; and he that soweth in
blessingis, schal repe and of blessyngis.’ Chaueer in 1116 Tale of Melisseas, p. 162, (ed.
WVright)‚‘says‚ ⁶ Right as men blamen an averous man, bycause of his skarsete and chyn-
cherie, in the same manere is he to blame, that spendeth ouer largely ;’ and again : ‘ And
afterward ye schul 1156 1116 1161165565, 1116 whiche ye han geten by youre witte and by
youre travalle, in such a maner, that men holde yow 1101 skarce ne to sparyuge, ne to fool
large, that is to say, over large a spender.’ Oecleve complaining that his salary was not.
regularly paid says—
