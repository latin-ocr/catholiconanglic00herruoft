¹ ⁸ Iozfandibzclzmn, a sunnon? Stanbridge.

² This seems to be only an error of the scribe for furlanqc, and not another form of the
word. ‘The fourtedele a surlange betwene thus he walkes.' Illorte Arthecre, 946.
‘Smdz'm A Furlonge.¹ Medulla.

³ ‘Salona A Fore. Szclcosus. Ful of forys.' Medulla. Thoresby in his Letter to Ray,
E. Dialeon Soc„ gives ‘a furre or foor, a furrow? A. S. furh. ‘ Ac sone sterte he vp of
the for3, And Charlis stede a gerde bor3, Dat was so fair of si3te.' Sir Ferambms, 5593.

¹ In P. Plowman, B. v. 576, Piers in directing the Pilgrims in the way to Truth‚ says—

‘ And so boweth forth bi a broke, beth-buxum-of-speche,
Tyl 3e fynden aforffz, 3oure-fadreshonoureth.'
Wyclif, Genesis xxxii. 2 2, has—‘And wh:mne Jacob hadde arise auysseli, he took hise twei
wyues, and so many seruauntessis with enleuen sones, and pass-ide the forthe of Jaboth.’

⁵ Neckham, ‘ De Utensilibus’ (Wright’s Vol. of Voeal).), identifies fusta'z'nc with cloths
fuscoffncti, dyed tawny or brown. Reginald of Durham in his work, De Admir. Beati
Cuthberti Virtutibus, mentions eloth faseotivnctum, dyed with (young) fecstic (which was
of a yellow colour and the produce of Venetiam Sumach, and was employed for dyeing
before it was almost wholly supplanted by the “ old fustic ’⁹ of America). From this mode
of dyeing, the original fustian, which was sometimes made of silk, may have had its name ;
or possibly from St. F uscien, a village near the cloth manufacturing city of Amiens. See
Liber Albus, p. 674, where it is ordered that foreign merchants are not to sell less than
‘mii fzcscotinctos,' sc, pannos. In an Inventory in the Pas-non Letters, iii. pp. 407, 409,
we find —‘ Item, a, dowblet of fostian, xld . . . . Item, a payr of stokes of ιΐιιείῐαη, viijd?
‘For v yerdes snstyan- for a cote at viid the yerd, iiS xid.’ Nicolas's Elizabeth of York,
p. 105. ⁸ Coleyne threde, fustium, and canvase' are among ‘the commodities . . . . fro
Pruse ibroughte into Flaundres,’ according to the Libelle, pr. in W'right's Pol. Songs, i. Ι 71,
Andrew Borde, in his Introduction, makes one of the Jauuayes (Genoese) say—-

⁴ I make good treacle, and also fastian,
With such tbynges Ι οΓὶιυῆ with many a pore man.’

⁶ In the Instructions to the Sheriffs of Counties, in reference to the practice of Archery‚
issued 37 Edward HL, we find pila bacularis, corresponding probably with our ‘ hockey,’
pila qmmualis, haud-hall, and pila pedica, foot-ball.

⁷ ‘ Pila : pes pontis.‘ Medulla. See P. ‘ Pyle of a bryggys fote, or oper byggynge. Pila?
Cooper has ‘Piloen Vitruvius, A pile, a heape, οι· damme made in the water to break
or stay the course.' we still use the term footinys for the first courses of brickwork.
