also named this ‘pathway in the sky' after terrestrial r‹›a‹le; thus Aventin‚ aGerman'
writer of the [oth century, called it Litorius] Strasse, after Euring, n. mythological hero.
The Italiam, similarly, named it ⁴ Scmta Sti-ada. cli Loretto,’ aud iu the North of Spain
and South of France it is known as Jacob's lVay, J aeobstrasse. Similmly, M ahmnmedans
call it the ‘ Hadji's way,' and in N orfolk it wae known as XValsingham Street, as though
pointing the way to the famous shrine at XValsingham.

³ Webbe (A. S. webba) is a male weaver in Ohaucer, Prol. 3623 the feminine is both
webbe (A. S. webbe 111 Beowuff, ed. Grein, 1942) and ’ωε-ᾔδεεν as here. Compare spynnesters
111 P. Plowman, B. V. 216, and woltewebstews in B. Prol. 219. The distinction between
the forms does not appear to have been strictly adhered to. Thus in P. Plowman, O. vii.
221‚we find--‘ My wis was a webbe, and woollen eloth made.⁷ Similarly, in Wright’s
vocab. p. 214, baoetea· and brewster are masculine, while at p. 216 they are feminine. ⁶ Hic
