¹ In the Μονίε Artlncre, when Priamus is wounded there ia an account of a ‘ Fovle of

fyne golde’ containing a liquid, the virtues of which were such that ν
‘ Be it frette on his flesche, thare synues are entamede
The freke sehaue be fische halle within fowre howres.' l. 2708.

4 Frithed is fenced in or inclosed, as in P. Plowman, B. V. 590 : ‘fritlzefl iu with
floreines.' From the O. H. G. frida, peace, protoetion, or inclosure, we have the A. S.
frip, used in composition in the sense of inclosed3 see Bosworth, s.v. ft'z'p-yercrd. In M.
English frith is frequently used for a wood, but properly only for one inelosed as dis-
tinguished from the open forest: cf. ‘frib or forest, toun 01· fild? ,Sir Amadas, lxxi;
William of Palen-ne, 2216, ‘Out of forest and stipes, and alle faire wodes: and Polit„ Bel.
‹t- Love Pocms, ed. F urnivall, p. 56, ‘ both by fritlc or foreste! Lammon, iii. 287, tells us
of Athelstan, ‘hu he sette sciren, and makede fri& of (leoren,' where the meaning is
‘ ‹leer-parks ;’ as also in i. 61—‘ 3e huntieffl i pes kinges friffle ' [later text parc} See also
Thomas of Erceldoune. 319, where Dr. Murray explains ‘ft-ythe or felle’ by ‘enclosed
field or open hin? The word is still preserved in many dialects ; see Pegge's Ix'enticisms,
E. Dial. Soc. ed. Skeat, &c.

⁵ In the Paston Lentem, ed. Gairdner‚ ii. 270, in the account of expenses at the funeral
of Sir J. Paston we find—‘For a eope called a fr099e of worsted for the Prior of Bromholm,
xxvi*¹ viijd.’ In the Treatise (Ie Utensilibus of Alexander N eckham, in Wright's Vol. of
Vocab. p. 101, we have collobimn glossed by ‘ froge’ and ‘roket.’ ‘ Frocke or cassock‚
gaqum) Baret. ‘Cucullum vestis capiciataf Medulla. See Ducange. s.v. Cucullae. In
Allit. Poems, ii. 136, in the parable of the man without a wedding garment he is said to
have been ‘A pral . . . unpryuandely clobed, Ne no festiual frok, but fyled with werrke3.’

'⁶ In the Description of the Giant in Morte Arthure, 1080, we are told that

‘ His frount and his forheuede, alle was it ouer,
As the felle of a froske, and fraknede it semede.'

In Deguileville's Pilffrymage δια, already quoted, p. 159, we read—‘I am thilke that
make my subgis dwelle and enhabite in sennes as frosshes.’ See also Caxton's Reynarcl
the Fooe, ed. Arber, p. 37. ‘ Aqredzcla. A lytyl ffrosch. Rana. A ffrosch. Ranzmculzae. A
lytyl ffrosch? lv1edulla. See Ανσῖιυῖοῑορὶα, xxx, 375, where it is stated that the herb
vex-vain is called frossis because its leaves are ‘lyke the froas-ys fet? Wyclif uses fresh in
Psalms lxxvii. 45, and cv. 30, and froslces occurs in the Story of Genesis (md Escodas, ed.
Morris, 2977, where we read—

‘ Polheuedes, and froskes‘, & podes spile Bond harde egipte folc in sile.’
