Among the works used by Mr. lVay was a MS. belonging to
Lord Monson, and entitled Cafholz'eon Anylienm. It may be
interesting to the reader to know how this work has at last got
into print. In the Report of the Early English Text Society for
1865 it was announced that- a series of old English Dictionaries
would be issued, to commence with two of the earliest and most
important printed ones, namely, Huloet's Moerim-ima and *Baret' 5
Ale-eme. &Vlien the preface to the Pronlptort'nm Parrulorzmz was
published in 1865, my attention was drawn to the Catholieon
Anfflz'cum therein described. Ι wrote to Mr. VVay respecting the
MS„ but he knew nothing about it since it had been lent to him
by the late Lord Monson, and he had used it in his notes. I
then communicated with Lord Monson, ‘but he could not at first
find the book. Before, however, the issue of a· second edition of
the Report his Lordship’s MS. had come to hand, and he most
kindly lent it to 1119 for the purpose of being copied 1. This
was done by Mr. Brock‚ who afterwards added the additional
entries from another MS. In 1866 the new edition of Levins’s
Dsanipulus Vocabulormn appeared, and the Cafleolicon Anylic-um was
placed on the list of works to be done by the Early English Text
Society. It was soon found that Huloet’s and Baret's fine old
volumes contained so much matter that it would be inexpedient
to print them on account of the great cost. Another MS. of the
‚Caflcolz'eon was found in the British Museum Library‚ and this
was collated with Lord Monson's MS. Ι had intended to edit
the work, but various circumstances prevented me from putting
it in hand. Another editor proposed to relieve me of the labour,
but he also was forced to relinquish his intention. At length
Mr. Herrtage came forward and undertook to edit the Dictionary,
and again Lord Monson most kindly lent us 1115 valuable MS.
for the purpose of verifying the proofs as the work was being
printed. Thus this interesting book, which remained for so many
years on the list of work to be done, is at length placed on the
more satisfactory list. of work accomplished. In a comparatively
short period, considering the large amount of research required

 

¹ Mr. Herrtage has alluded in his ‘Introduction' to the obligatior} we are all
under to Lord Mmson, but Ι wish specially to express my personal thanks sor

the genereus manner in which his Lordship handed the MS. over to me without
stipulations of any kind.
