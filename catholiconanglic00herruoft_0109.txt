¹ ‘ Bullace, a small black and tartish plum.’ Halliwell. They are mentioned in
Tusser’s Five Hundred Points, chap. 34. 4. Bullace plums are in Cambridgeshire called
crielcsies. ‘ Bolaces and blacke-beries bat on breres growen.' william of Palerne, ed. Skeat,
1809. See also Romaunt of the Rose, 1377. Irish balae, a prune ; Breton polos, a bul-
lace; Gael. bulaisiear, a sloe. ‘Bellocimn A bullace-tree or wilde plum-tree.’ Cotgrave.
‘ A bussace, frute. Pruneolumff Manip. Vocab.

²¹ ⁴ Buzllwad, the fish, Miller's thumb.' Cotgrave gives ‘ Asne, m. an asse; also a little
fish with a great head, called a Bull-head‚ or Bsiller's thumbe.’ According to Cooper
Capito is a ⁶ coddefishe.’ The term is still in common use in the North for a tad-pole, in
which sense it also occurs in Cotgrave : ‘ cuz-egat. A Pele-head, or Bull·head ; the little
vermine, whereof toads and srogs do come.’ See also ibid„ s. v. Testard. ‘Hic mullus,
Am, a bulhyd.’ Wright’s Vol. of Vocab., p. 253.

³ Apparently this means either the handle or a stud of a door. In Mr. N odal's Glossary
os Lancashire, E. Dialeet Society, is given ⁶ Bule. The handle of a pot, pan, or other
uteusil. At Lancaster the flat wooden handle of an osier market-basket.' Halliwell also
has ‘Bolls. The ornamental knobs 011 a bedstead. See Howell‚ sect. 12.’ A. S. bolla.
See note to Burdun of a Buke. below. The Medulla explains ‘ Grappa' by ‘foramem’ but
yrapa in the present instance appears to be a made-up word, suggested by the knob-like
or grape-like form of the thing meant.

4 In the Treatise of Walter de Biblesworth (13th century), Wright's Volume of Vocabu-
laries, p. 1 5 5, is mentioned ‘ a bolmye' or bultivy—ozoss the glossary continuing—

‘ Per holenqer (bullinyqe) est cevere La flur e le furfre (of bren) demorel
And in Kennett's Antiquities of Ambrosden, a ⁶ bzclterwlofflss The mediaeval Latin name
for the implenient was ‘taratantara’ (see AElfrio’s A. S. Glossary), from the peeuliar
noise made by it when at work ; a word borrowed from Ennius, as sig-nisying the sound
of a trumpet, in Priscian, bk. viii. A portable bonlter was called a ‘tiffany.‘ Bultellzcs
occurs in the Liber Custumarum, p. 106. ‘ Bolcinq Cloth, a eloth used for sifting meal in
mills. In 1534, the Guild of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Boston possessed ‘a brcltynsse
pipe covered with a yearde of canvesse,⁷ and also ‘ij bulthgye clothes? Peacock, English
Church Furniture, p. 189, quoted in Peacock's Glossary of hIanley &c.‚ E. D. Soc. In the
Unton Inventories, p. 29, occurs, ‘in the Bozzltyuqe house, one dough trough‚ ij boltinq
wittches' (hutches), i.e. vessels into which meal is sifted. ‘Boltinffi the coarse meal
separated from the fleur? Peacock’s Glossary. See also Paston Letters, iii. 419. The
word came to be used metaphorically as in the phrase ⁴ to boult out the truth‚’ i. e. to sift
the matter thoroughly and ascertain the truth. Thus in Tusser‚ Five Hundred Points of
Good Husbandn'e (E. Dial. Soc„ ed. Hem-tage, p. 152)—
‘If truth were truely bolted out, As touching thrift, Ι stand in doubt
If men were best to wiueff
