Holland, would have been of the greatest service to me had it

appeared earlier.
The publications of the English Dialect Society have furnished

mc with abundant instances of dialectal forms and words occur—
ring in the Catholicon, and still in use in our Northern Counties.

BIore especially have Ι been indebted to the Glossaries of Mr. E.

Pcacock (Lincolnshire)‚ Mr. C. C. Robinson (Mid-Yorkshire), Mr. .

Nodal (Lancashire), and Prof. Skeat’s editions of Ray, &c.

Many of my illustrations‚ as well as hints and helps for many
others are due to the publications of the late Mr. Riley for the
Rolls Series. His editions of the Liber Albus and the Liber
Cnstumarzcm are crammed with bits of archaeological lore, which
have added vastly to the value of my notes to which I have
freely transferred them 1.

Ι have, of course, placed all the publications of the Early
English Text Society under contribution, many of them, espe-
cially those most recently issued, Ι had to read through myself
for the purpose, as they are not included in Stratmann. Of the
publications of the Camden Society the most useful to me
have been the Tlcorntcm Romcmees, the Aneren Rc'wle, and the
Bury W ills ᾇ [φιυεηίονὶε3, the last containing a large number of
valuable and interesting words and forms.

But the most valuable works to me have been the Wills ᾇ In-
veutories, the Testamenta Eboraeensia‚ and other publications of
the Surtees Society. It is impossible to speak too highly of the
importance of these works to all students of our lang-uage and its
history. Extending as they do over a period of more than 500
years, from 1085 to 1600, they afford an almost inexhaustible
mine of material to the student, and the complete glossary and
index which we are promised to them and the other issues of
the Society will be one of the most valuable works in existence.
Next in importance to the Wills ᾇ Inventories eomes the Fal-miny
ᾇ Ασοοαφιί Books of Heury Best, a Yorkshire farmer, who died in

 

¹ Ι deeply regret that by an oversight Ι have in two instances omitted accidentally
to acknowledge the sources of my notes. A great part of those under Baynstikffle
and Baudsssrot are from notes of Mr. Riley, in his Glossaries to the Liber Albus and
Liber Cuatumarum. These are, Ι believe, the only instances in which Ι have
omitted to give my authorities and the credit which is due to the original writer.
