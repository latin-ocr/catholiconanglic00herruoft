maryelyne? Palsgrave. Turner in his Herbal, p. 20, says: ⁴ Some call thys herbe in
englysh mei-ieram gyentle, to put a difference betwene an other herbe called merierum, which
is but a bastard kynde‚ and this is y⁰ true kynde. ssserv'erum is a thicke and busshy herbe
creping by the ground, with leues lyke small calaminte roughe and 1·ounde.' The form
maim-om, which is strictly correct, being from the Ital. *majoram (for the change of η to
m compare holm, lime, διο.) occurs in Tusser, ch. xlii„ where the plantis mentioned amongst
‘ strowing herbes of all sortes? I have inserted the r in the text, as the alphabetical position
of the word requires it.

The Mark in weight was equal to 8 ounces or two-thirds of a pound tmy, and the gold
coin was in early times equa] to six pounds, or nine marks of silver ; but in the reign of
King John it was worth ten marks of silver. See Madox, Hv‘st. Exclzeq. i. pp. 277, 487.

³ The author of the Story of Genesis ὡ Emodus tells us, l. 439, of Cain after he became
an outlaw, that ¹ Met of corn, and wigte of fe, And ‘merke of felde, first fond he.’

³ Mr. Peaeock in his Gloss. of Manley & Coninghmn, E. D. Soc. says that on the wolds
‘marl is used as equivalent to clcalk ,· in other districts it is equivalent to hard clay. Cooper
gives ‘qli-s, potter's clay! ‘ Marle, or chaulky claye. IlIaoyaff Huloet. ⁶ Glitosus. Marly.'

⁵ This appears from Cotgrave to be a water-mill, but I have been unable to find any
instance of the word. ‘fllartinet A martlet or martin (bird); also, a water-lnill sor an
yron forge‚' that is, a forge hammer driven by water power. Ducange defines murcinctus
as a ⁶ forge, a martellz's seu malleis sic dicta.’

⁶ In Old Enq. Homilies, ii. 163, the author, while inveighing against the abuses amongst
the clergy, complains that they neglect their churches for their ⁴ daie‚' and that while ⁴ ’ὅο
caliz is of tin, hire nap [is] of mazeress ⁴ cantaras, a masere) hffiedulla. In the Harl. MS.
trans. of Higden, Vi. 471, we read, ‘ Kynge Edgare made nayles to be fixede in his mascrs

and deepe, suche as great masers were wont to bee.' In Wn'ght’s Vol. of Vocab. p. 181,
‘masere’ is used as a gloss for mirra. The maser-tree is the acer campestre L. In Ι 381 Lord
Latymer bequeathed ‘les mazcrs et le grant almesdych d'argent.' Test. Eborac. i. 114.
