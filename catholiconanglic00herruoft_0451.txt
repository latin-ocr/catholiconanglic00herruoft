280. J. R„ in his translation of Mouffet’s Theater of Insects, p. 1048, says of the wood-
louse: ⁵ The Latines call it Asellum, emtionem, Porcellz'onem ; Pliny said not well to call
it (lentipes, since it hath but fourteen feet : the English from the form call them Some,
that is, little Hogs ε from the place where they dwell, Tylersdoase, that is, Lice in roofs of
houses ε they are called also Tharstows, or J ovial Lice, from a spirit that was not hurtful,
to whom our Ancestors superstitiously imputed the sending of them to us, In some places
also they call them Clwrbays, and Cheslip& but Ι know not why.’ According to Halliwell
the millipes is called a Hob-thrash-louse. I can offer no suggestion as to the origin or
meaning of the latin equivalents here given.

de Biblesworth, as quoted by Mr. VVay in note to Thun wonge :

of which a different version is given in Wn‘ght’s Vol. of Vocab. p. 144-—
