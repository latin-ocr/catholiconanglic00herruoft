‘ „Mortrews of fysshe,’ which runs as follows—-

Moffet & Bennet in their Ilealtlz’s Improvemmzt, 1655, p. ²58, say, ‘Cods have a Bladder

that a duchess descended from the clouds ‘with kelle and with corenalle clenliche arrayede :'

and in Wright's Pol. Songs, p. 158, we read ‘ uncomely under calle? Baret gives ‘ a caule
to coner the heare as maydens doe, reticulata, une cceffe ,· a caule for the head, crobgslon,

import into Eugland ‘ any maner silke wrought by it selfe, 01 with any other stuffe in any

place out of this Realm in [tibbandfiu Laces, GirdleS, Corses, Galles, 001565 of Tissues, or

Points, vpon pain of forfeiture.' Although the cau! or kelle was chiefly used with refer-

ence to the omiamental network worn by ladies over their hair, we find it occasionally used

for a man's skull-cap. Thus in P. Plowinan, B, xv. 223, Charity is described as ⁶ ycalletl

and ycrimiled, and his crowne shaue ;’ and in Troilus ιί· 01055ἰᾶ0, iii. 727 ε ‘ maken hym a

howue abone a calle.’
