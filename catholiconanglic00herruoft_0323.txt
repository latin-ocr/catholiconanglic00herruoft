¹ An ordinary is the person who has the ordering and regulation of ceremonies, dnties,

δια, in which sense the word is still retained

in the Prayer-book. This would appear to

be the meaning in the Con-entry Myse. p. 87: ‘The fyfte to obey the ordenaryes of the
temple echeon: but the e litor glosses it by ordimmzces.

² See Prof. Skeat’s note to P. Plowman, C.

xxi. 7.

³ Unclern or underntide was properly the third bour of the day, or 9 a.m.‚ but it appears

to have been sometimes loosely used for the forenoon generally. Thus in the account of
the crucifixion as given in the Cam-‚302- Mandz', 16741‚ we find—
‘ Bi pis was rndren on lje dai, Dat mirckend al pe light:
where the meaning is the sixth hour or noon. Robert of Brunne in his Glcronicle, p. 243,
describes the death of WVencssian, daughter of Llewellyn of WVales, as oceurn‘ng ‘ bituex
vndron and prime.‘ See also Chaucer, Nonnes Pv-estes Tale, 4412, and Olcrkes Tale, 260.
Iu the Ancren Riwle, p. 24, anohoresses are directed to say ‘ seoue psalmes <St teos {istene
psalmes . . . abuten andern deies :' see also p. 400. In the Ormalam, 19458, it is related
how ‘ Godess gast off heffne comm Ι firess onnlicnesse
Uppo pe Laferrd Cristess hird, An da33 att annderrn time.'
Wyclif in his version of Mark Χν. 25 has : ⁵ forsoth it was the thrinlde our (that men clepen
vmlrnn) and thei crucifieden him ;' while in John iV. 6 he says: ‘ sothli the our was, as
the sixte, οι· τη(ῑιι7·η.’ In Acts ii. 15 it is again ‘ the thridtle our of the day, or vmlirne!
In the Allit. Poems, A. 512, the third hour is meant—-
⁶ Aboute vnder, be lord to marked t0t3 δι ydel men stande he fynde3 per—ate?
See also Genesis ιὶ· Emodus, 2269. Amongst his hymns for the ‘ oui-es ¹ Shoreham has for
the third hour or tieree, ‘ Crucyfige l crucifige Ξ Gredden hy at ondre.’ In the Lay-Follcs
M ass-Book, p. 131‚ intending travellers are recommended before starting
‘ to here a masse to ende Ι rede beo vnderne ar pon go
In be Morennynge 3if Pow may; Or elles be hei3 inidday.'
And 3if pou may not do so

4 ‘Gozlbem An aunders-meat or asternoones repast.’ cotgrave. See Ray's North Comztry
Words, E. D. Soc. s. υ. Aandorn, and compare a Nune mete, above, and P. Vudermele.
Trevisa in his trans. of Higden, v. 373, has ‘under-mele tyde.'
