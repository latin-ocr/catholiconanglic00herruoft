xii PREFACE.

the fact that Jordan almonds were mentioned in printed books
at least as far back as 1607. At last Mr. Hanson found his
clue in the Promptoriuna where we read, ‘Iardyne almaunde‚
amiffllalum jardinmn? The difficulty was overeome, and the
Jordan almond stood revealcd as nothing more than a garden or
cultivated kind of almond.

Iu contrasting Mr. Herrtage's edition of the Catholieon with
Mr. VVay's edition of the Promptorimn a very interesting point
must needs become apparent. Mr. VVay annotated and ex-
plained the difficulties of his text with the most unwearied
patience, but his authorities were to some extent limited. He
himself helped to create the taste which has induced so many
scholars to come forward and rescue the monuments of our lan-
guage from destruction. Every one of Mr. Herrtage's pages bears
evidence of the large amount of work which has been done since
the Camden Society first issued the Promplorium. Publications
of the Early English Text Society are quoted on every page, and
Stratmann and Matzner are put under frequent contribution.
We thus see that the labours of late years have already brought
forward a rich harvest of illustration, by means of which the
difficulties of our beloved tongue are gradually being cleared up.
hIany words once in use are doubtless irrecoverably lost, but still
much has been garnered up. Those who have not attempted to
register words can hardly realise the difficulties in the way of
the Dictionary maker. All honour, therefore, to those who
have overcome the difficulties, and in this band of honest workers
the anonymous compiler of the Catholicon Anglicum occupies a
prominent place. The difficulties are truly great, but the
lexicographer has his compensation‚ for there is a pleasure in
the registration and illustration of words which he only knows
who has set his mind to the work with earnestness and en-
thusiasm.
