convenience attending the existence of a double set of notes,
and the risk which exists of additional notes being overlooked,
Ι do not know that any apology for their presence is necessaryl.
In any work of this class it is absolutely unavoidable that fresh,
and in many cases better, illustrations of words will crop up
after the sheets have been printed off. Extended reading has
brought extended knowledge, and the value of these additions
—and I believe that much of value will be found in them—
will be, I think, the best apology for their existence.

Ι adopted Lord Monson's MS. as the basis of my text: first,
because it was the fuller and more correct of the two, besides
which it was ready copied out for me3 and secondly, because it
was perfect. The difference in date between the two MSS„ if
there is any difference‚ can be but a few years, and was not of
itself of sufficient importance to counterbalance other considera-
tions. The Addit. MS. has lost one leaf at the beginning and
two at the end, besides three in the body of the work. It is,
moreover, so full of palpable and gross errors both in the
English and Latin, from which Lord Monson's MS. is free,
that Ι had no hesitation in relegating it to a second place, to
be used only for the purposes of collation and of filling up
gaps. One most curicus point about it· is that while up to
S it contains far fewer words than Lord Monson's MS„ from
that letter on it has more than double the entries. Why this
is so it is, of course, impossible to say: the ent-ries are here
given in full.

§Q Lord Monson's MS. of the Catholicon is a thick paper
volume measuring 8} inches by 6. It is perfect, and in almost
as good condition as when it left the scriptorium. It consists of

 

¹ I have, at all events, done my best to prevent their being overlooked or
forgotten‚ by inserting them before the text. As an example of the liability of
such additional notes to be overlooked when not placed in some conspicuous part
of the book, I may mention that on* February 14th, 1880, Ι printed in Notos
and Querics a short list of errors in Mr. VVay’s Promptorizcm, which Ι had
come across while using the work sor this edition of the Cathol‘z'con. To my
great surprise Ι was infor-med by a note from a correspondent in that paper,
that most of the slips pointed out by me had been discovered by Mr. way, and
were mentioned and corrected in a list printed at p. 560 of the Promptorium.
And there Ι found them, but I am confident that not one in a hundred of those
who nse the volume is aware of the existence of the list.
