¹ See note to Luce, p. 222. Cooper has ‘ denter, a certaine fishe 3' the word is evidently
derived from the sharp leeth of the pike. Cotgrave gives ‘lauret-072, a jeg, or jack, a piokerel
that’s about a foot long? ‘ A pike, fish, lupus. A liic-kress, lupellus? Manip. Vocab. ‘ I
have layde for a piekrell, but Ι wene I shall catche a frogge 2 jay tenda pour '²7²9 brochetmz,
‘manys je peuce queje prendat-y eve yrenonylle? Iffalsgrave. ⁶ ῃ
The up or polnt. A pilgrnn's staff was tipped With iren, as we see 111 R. Cesar de
Lien, 61 1-— ‘ They were redy for to wende.
With pyke and with selavyn,
As palmers were in Paynym?
Cf. also P. Plowman‚ B. ν. 482, where Robert the robber
‘ Knowleched his gult to cryst eftsones
bat penitencia his pyke 116 shulde pol-eche newe‚
And lepe with hym ouer londe, al his lys ty1ne.'
See also C. xxiii. 219. So. too, Chaueer describing the friar says—
¹ With scrip and pykecl staf, y-touked hye, And beggyd mele or cheese, or eliis corn.'
In every hous he gan to pore and prye, Sompnonre's Tale, 7319.
Topsell in his Hist.0fF01m·-f00ted Beasts, p. 32, tells< how they used to catch bears in
Norway by sawing a tree ‘ ahnos‘c asunder, so that when the beash climbeth it, she falleth
down upon pilced stares laid underneath.⁷ Palsgrave gives ‘ Ι pyeke a staffe with pykes of
yron, J e enquantelle. This staffe is well pyked with iron. Pyke of a staff& piqzeant?
‘Piked wyth yron, or hauynge a. pyeke of yron. Roslralns.’ Huloet. Compare to Pike
with A wande, below. In P. Plowman, C. xxiii. 219, we read of ‘pilscde show: that is
shoes with long pointed toes, afterwards called ‘Cracows,' from the idea that they were
originally imported from Craeow. See Mr. Peacock's note ‘co Mire's I nso-not. for Parish.
Prie-sle, l. 43, where priests are forbidden to wear ‘ cuttede clothes and pykecl echone)
3 ‘ Euery man the rekand schidis in fere
Rent fra the fyris, and on the schippis slang . . . .
The talloned burdis kest ane piltlsy low,
Vpblesis ouerloft‚ hebsehis, wranffis and hOW.'

4 The author of Genesis ὠ Exodns tells us, 1. 377, that
⁴ Two pilches weren u&urg engeles wrogb, eor-xvix he ben nu bob‘en srid,

the reference being to Genesis iii. 21, where Wyelif has ‘Iebher cootis,’ and the authorisel
version ‘coats of skin,' tunicas pelliceas Vulg. In the Seven Sages, 1. 473. we read—
