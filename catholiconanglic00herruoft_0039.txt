Bedstoeks. This is of frequent occurrence in 15th—1 7th century wills and inven-
tories. Thus 111 1567 Edward Parkinson had amongst his goods, ‘one pare of cerved
bedstoltes‚ with bedding and hangings, iijl. vis. viijd ..... two pare ofbedslolce& with
bedding, xxvifl. viij‘¹.’ Wizls 11· [111-6111. 1. 272 ; and in 1541, in the Invent. of Roger Pele,
are mentioned ‘iij parre of bed-stole& price xij⁵.’ Richmond. Wills, 810. p. 22 ; see also ibid.

Bedstrey. Tusser, Five Hzcmlresl Points. ch. xix. st. 40, 11565 beclstraw for clean
straw: ‘ By thend of October, go gather vp 51065,

Beke handes. I have no doubt now that my note on this word is wrong, and
that the true reading 15 ‘ to Bake wandes.' I was led astra-y by the latin equivalent, and
the Ortus. The meaning is to heat unseasoned wood by the fire for the purpose of
straightening it. Thus Neckam 111 1115 treatise De L'tensilz‘bccs, in Wright's Vol. of Vocab.
p. 11 1, says a fai-mer should have
⁶ bastuns peuz endurziz idem

fustes et palos sepius ‘in ique probatos ‘ffel exploratos ,·' and H. Bcst says, ‘after that
we have cutte our wilfes and saughs, and sorted them . . . . wee sette our foreman and
another to bea-Isinye of them ; and for this purpose they fetch a bottle of pease-strawe7 01·
a bottle of barley-strawe, and then doe they take the stickes and sette them vp an ende
slanttiuge against the hudde, and keepe a good 111-6 under them.’ Farminy, (stc. Book, p.
122. The verb is still common in the North: in chcine ‹ss- Gazam, 1459, a knight 15
described as lying ‘belceaml in his bed 3⁷ and Μαι-11115111 111 1115 Coemtrey Farme, 1616, says ε
‘ when you bring your grey-hound home at night, you shall bring him to a faire fire, aud
there let him healfe and stretch himselfe‚ and doe you ticke him at the least an honre 01·
more before 1011 put him into his kennell.’ In Le Bone Florem'e. 99, we have :

By this we may explain the entries in the Promptorium τ ‘ Beykynge or streykynge

saprum strekyug, to strikynge oute P.). Extenclo. protensio.² The more common form
(still survivmg in the provinces) 15 to beath, which is used by Tusser, ch. xxiii. st. 9 :
⁶ Yokes, forks9 and such othir, let bailie spie out,
and gather the same as he walketh about.
And after at leasure let this be 1115 hier,

on which Tusser Redivivus (D. Hihnan) notes : ‘ Bathinss at the Fire, as it 15 commonly
called, when the wood 15 yet unseasoned‚ sets it to what purpose you think fit) See also

27. Belle man. John Baret in his Will, 1463, directed that ‘the ij bellemen haue ij
gownys, and be ij of ye fyve to 1101116 10101165, and ijd. and here mete. and y⁰ Sexteyn ofy³
chirche to haue brede and drynkke and xijd. sor his rynggyng and his mete? Bury Wills,
810. p. 1 7; and again, p. 28, he directs ‘ that the belle mean haue iiijd. to go yeerly abnvte
the town at my yeerday for my 501116 aud for my faderis and my niodryS.’ On the other
hand John Coote, in 1502, declares he will have ‘ neyther ryngyn nor belmcm goynge‚' but
all ‘to be dou in secrete maner ι’ ibid. p. 92. The duty of these bellmen was to go mund
a town on the anniversary of the death of any person, calling on all who heard thom to
pray for the soul of the departed. In 1433 John Dene, Canon of Rip‹›n, left in his Will to
