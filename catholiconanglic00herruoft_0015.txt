CORRECTIONS.

Mr. J. H. Hesse1s‚ who is editing a new and revised edition of Du Gange
for Mr. John Mul-ray, has pointed out a mistake in the reading of the Addit.
MS. under Defoulle, p. 94‚col. 1, l. 15, viz: corpora. It stands in the MS. ‘ cor
Α] which should, of course, have been printed as ‘correpta A? as in other ωερε
throughout the volume. In some cases these notes of the compiler will be found
to have been omitted when only oecurring in the Addit. MS. This is due in a
great measure to the fact that the Addit. MS. was used mainly for purposes
of eollation and filling up gaps. In some cases, too, Latin words oecurring in
the Addit. MS. have been passed over. This was done sometimes inten-
tionally, 011 the ground that the differenee in spelling was very slight.
Occasionally‚ however, both Mr. Brock and myself have no doubt missed
some words which occur only in the Addit. MS„ and this is aocounted for
by the fact that the Latin equivalents in the two MSS. are not given in
the same order, so that when many equivalents were given it was an easy
matter to miss one or more, in spite of all our care. My business lay mainly
with the English words, the Latin equivalents being of secondary importance,
though they prove to be of great value to Mr. Hessels for his work. It is to
be hoped that some Mediaeval Latin Text Society or some German Editor
will supplement my work by printing the Addit. MS. in full.

Introduction, pp. xv, xvi: my note as to conquesta-s is au wrong. The in-
scription simply means ‘ in the fifteenth year of the seventh Henry after the
Conquest.' Ι was misled by the fact that there had been no Henrys before
the Conquest.

List ⁰f Aatkoricies. The date of La3amon is misprinted 1305, instead of
1205.
