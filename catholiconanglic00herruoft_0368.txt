3 It is difficult to identify this plant. Halh'weH says that in Essex Rtb means the
common water-cress, but in a 15th cent. gloss. in Wright's Vol. of Vocab. p. 226, ‘ rybbe ’
is glossed by costas, which Cooper identifies with that ‘ commonly called Cocus and Herba
Maria? that is, costmary. On the other hand, the gloss. in MS. Cott. Cle-op. A. iii. lf. 76
gives ⁴ Cinoylosa. ribbe,⁷ and so the A.-S. Gloss. printed by Wright, p. 66. In the 13th
cent. trilingual gloss. of plants, ibid. p. 140, we have 6Εαηεσοῖαέα, launceleie, ribbe,' and so
in P. ⁵ Rybbeworte. Lanoiola.‘ It may be worth noting, as the word does not occur in
Halliwell, although it is certainly not the plant here referred to, that Lyte, Dodoens, p.
683, gives the name Rites to the Gooseberry: ‘The first kind is called Grossaloe mbroe,
